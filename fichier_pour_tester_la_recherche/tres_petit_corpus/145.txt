The Charophyceae are the green algae closest to plants Their exact rank is the matter of some debate Some botany botanists recommend expanding the existing Plantae plant kingdom to include charophyceans and Chlorophyta chlorophytes Others classify Charophyceae as a class under division Charophyta with Chlorophyta remaining a distinct division The consensus among botanist s is that charophyceans are the organisms most closely related to land plants Many of the complex plant Trait shows that characteristics of plant chloroplasts also evolved first in the charophyceans before the Zygnematales diverged from the lineage that lead to Coleochaetales Charales and the land plants Groups generally included within the Charophyceae are Mesostigmatales Klebsormidiales Zygnematales Desmidiales Charales Coleochaetales
