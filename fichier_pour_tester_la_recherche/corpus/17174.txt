The Hadean is the geology geological eon before the Archaean It began at the Earth s Age of the Earth formation about billion years ago and ended billion years ago The name Hadean comes from Hades Ancient Greek Greek for Underworld due to the conditions on the Earth at the time The geologist Preston Cloud first used the term in Meteorite bombardment volcano volcanism and high temperatures were very widespread on the early Earth There are no sedimentary rock s from the Hadean at all The earliest geological objects on Earth are some zircon s dated to about million years ago Oceans would probably have formed as soon as the temperature allowed It is thought that constant bombardment kept the Earth in a molten state until about the end of the eon Early in Earth history the Moon was torn out by a massive collision with a proto planet The evidence for this giant impact hypothesis is the remarkable similarity between the Earth s crust and the Moon s composition the low iron concentration in the Moon s centre and the high angular momentum of the Earth Moon system An explanation for the general lack of Hadean rocks is the large amount of rocky and icy debris present in the early Solar System After the eight planets formed large numbers of leftover proto planet s asteroids and comet s pursued eccentric orbits throughout our system bombardment bombarding the early Earth and the other planets and moons until approximately mya This activity may have prevented any large crustal fragments from forming by literally shattering the early protocontinents A barrage of particularly large impacts known as the Late Heavy Bombardment represents the climax of this violent era No life forms are known from this eon The early atmosphere contained carbon dioxide methane and nitrogen but almost no oxygen
