Web sites that accept postings from the public like this wiki are often abused by spammers who use automated tools to post their links to many sites While these spam links can be removed they are a nuisance Because of this when making a new account and sometimes also when adding new website links to a page you may be shown an image of colored or twisted text of or a simple number question and be asked to type the words or answer the question Since it is harder for a robot to see an image it will let most real humans make accounts and post links while stopping spam robots from doing this Unfortunately this may be hard for users with limited vision who may be using text based or speech based browsers Right now we do not have a way to do this with audio Please contact the site administrators for help if this is causing you any problem If you can t see any image you may need to enable cookies in your computer s browser Hit the back button on your browser to return
