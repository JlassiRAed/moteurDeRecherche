The lift coefficient lift generated by an airfoil the dynamic pressure of the fluid Flux flow around the airfoil and the planform area of the airfoil It may also be described as the ratio of lift pressure to dynamic pressure Lift coefficient may be used to relate the total Lift lift generated by an aircraft to the total area of the wing of the aircraft Lift coefficent may also be used as a characteristic of a particular shape of an airfoil The lift coefficient is a Dimensionless quantity dimensionless number physics stub
