 Pronunciation of English words in Wikipedia is most often given in the International Phonetic Alphabet or IPA The goal is that interpretation should not depend on the reader s dialect and therefore a broad transcription is generally used Since this key covers standard British and Australian pronunciations not all of the distinctions shown here will be important to your language If for example you pronounce cot and caught the same you can ignore the difference between the symbols in the pronunciation guides where you would not pronounce it This key does not encode the difference between the vowels of bad and lad in Australian English nor between fir fur and fern in Scottish English For better use of the IPA to show the differences between English dialects to transcribe languages other than English or if the IPA symbols are not displayed on your browser see the links at the bottom of this page Readers unfamiliar with IPA may be helped by en Pronunciation respelling for English
