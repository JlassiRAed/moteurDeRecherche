A colony in biology refers to a life style or wikt habit habit where members of the same species live together Usually the members of a colony are genetics genetically linked by common heredity Sometimes as in bryozoa they are genetically identical clone s sometimes as in eusociality they are members of an extended family Sometimes as with the Portuguese Man o War the members of the colony are joined together as one individual which operates as a single unit Most of the colonies in the groups listed below build a common structure or nest Sometimes they are linked only by their behaviour The close integration of termite s ant s bee s and wasp s is called eusocial The term applies mostly to animals though there are some protist s and prokaryote s which live as colonies
