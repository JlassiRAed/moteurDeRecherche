The iguanodonts are members of the proposed group Iguanodontia Iguanodontidae Camptosauridae Dryosauridae Hadrosauridae Rhabdodontidae That is all the ornithopods except for the small fast running Hypsilophodon This is placed in the family Hypsilophodontidae However the important reference work Vertebrate Paleontology is not yet in support of this trend and lists the families separately as Ornithopod s The proposal is therefore still under discussion
