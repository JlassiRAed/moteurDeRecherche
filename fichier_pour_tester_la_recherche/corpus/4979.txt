In cryptography a pre shared key or PSK is a shared secret which was previously shared between the two parties using some secure channel before it is used Such systems almost always use Symmetric key algorithm symmetric key cryptographic algorithms The characteristics of this shared secret secret or Key key are determined by the system which uses it some system require that such keys be in a specific format It can be a password like breti a passphrase like Idaho hung gear id gene or a hexadecimal string like E E EEE The secret is used by all systems involved in the cryptographic processes used to secure the traffic between the systems The term is used in Wi Fi encryption such as Wired Equivalent Privacy WEP or Wi Fi Protected Access WPA where both the Access point wireless access points and all clients share the same key Since one weakpoint of the Cryptosystem crypto system is the encryption algorithm s Key There are several tools available to help one choose a strong key The Diceware Diceware method is one example
