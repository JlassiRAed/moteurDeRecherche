 Polymerase chain reaction is a way to make many copies of a sequence of DNA This is done in a lab using an enzyme called DNA polymerase It is called chain reaction because the result of one cycle is used immediately for the next cycle This allows exponential growth to happen PCR has many uses in a biological or biochemistry biochemical setting Because DNA is unique for every living thing experimenters can often extract only small amounts of the DNA they are interested in from a specimen These amounts are usually too little to be useful and so a scientist will use PCR to make enough copies to start experimenting with For this reason it is one of the most common techniques used in genetics labs around the world making it useful in experiments on many things including gene therapy infectious diseases and even forensics This process was developed in by Kary Mullis He was not the first person to develop the PCR process but he was the first to make the process usable He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry along with Michael Smith for their work in the PCR process
