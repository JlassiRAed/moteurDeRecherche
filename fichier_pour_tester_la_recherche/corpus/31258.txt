 The s block is one of four blocks of elements on the periodic table The s block group have a common property The electron in their most outward electron shell are in the s orbital The elements in group one are called the alkali metal s The elements in group two are called the alkaline earth metal s The modern periodic law says that The property properties of elements are periodic function of their atomic number This means that some properties of elements are repeated as the atomic number of the elements gets larger These repeating properties have been used to separate the elements into four block blocks These blocks are s block p block d block and f block
