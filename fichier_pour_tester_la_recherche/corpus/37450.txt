 Trial and error is a primitive method of solving problems It is characterised by repeated varied attempts which are continued until success or until the agent stops trying It is an unsystematic method which does not employ insight theory or organised methodology According to W H Thorpe the term was devised by C Lloyd Morgan after trying out similar phrases trial and failure and trial and practice Under Morgan s canon animal behaviour should be explained in the simplest possible way Where behaviour seems to imply higher mental processes it might be explained by trial and error learning An example is the skilful way in which his terrier Tony opened the garden gate easily misunderstood as an insight ful act by someone seeing the final behaviour Lloyd Morgan however had watched and recorded the series of approximations by which the dog had gradually learned the response and could demonstrate that no insight was required to explain it Edward Thorndike showed how to manage a trial and error experiment in the laboratory In his famous experiment a cat was placed in a series of puzzle boxes in order to study the law of effect in learning He plotted learning curves which recorded the timing for each trial Thorndike s key observation was that learning was promoted by positive results which was later refined and extended by B F Skinner s operant conditioning
