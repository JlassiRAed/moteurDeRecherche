In cryptography RC RC is known for being simple and quick but attacks are likely to happen when the start of the output keystream is not removed or one keystream is used twice some ways of using RC can turn into very insecure cryptosystem s such as Wired Equivalent Privacy WEP RC was created by Ron Rivest of RSA Security in While its official name is Rivest Cipher the RC acronym is also known to stand for Ron s Code RC was first created as a trade secret but in September a description of it was posted to the Cypherpunks mailing list It was soon posted on the sci crypt newsgroup and from there to many website s on the Internet The code was confirmed to be genuine to avoid possible trademark problems It has become part of some commonly used Cryptographic protocol encryption protocol s and standards including Wired Equivalent Privacy WEP and Wi Fi Protected Access WPA for wireless cards and Transport Layer Security TLS The two main reasons which helped its use over such a big range of application s are its speed and simplicity Uses of RC in both software and hardware are extremely easy to develop The RC encryption algorithm is started with a different Key size key length usually between and bits using the key schedule key scheduling algorithm RC fails the standards set by Cryptanalysis cryptographers for a secure cipher in many ways and is not recommended for use in new applications as there are a lot of methods of attacking RC Dropping the first kilobyte of data from the keystream can improve the security somewhat
