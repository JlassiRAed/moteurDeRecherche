A knockout mouse is a genetic engineering genetically engineered house mouse mouse in which one or more gene s have been turned off by a gene knockout Knockout mice are important animal Model organism model s for studying the role of genes which have been DNA sequencing sequenced but whose function s are not yet known By causing a specific gene to be inactive in the mouse and observing any differences from normal behaviour or condition researchers can infer its probable function Mice are currently the most closely related model organism laboratory animal species to human s for which the knockout technique can easily be applied They are widely used in knockout experiments especially those genetic questions which relate to human physiology Gene knockout in brown rat rats is much harder and has only been possible since The first knockout mouse was created by Mario Capecchi Mario R Capecchi Martin Evans and Oliver Smithies in for which they were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for A detailed explanation of how knockout mice are produced is at the website of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine Nobel Prize detailed explanation of the work Aspects of the technology for generating knockout mice and the mice themselves have been patent ed in many countries by private companies
