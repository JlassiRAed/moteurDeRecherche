The Pachycephalosaurs are a group of ornithopod dinosaur s in the suborder Cerapoda Their thick round skull s were used for wikt defence defence and probably for mating contests In some species the skull roof is domed and several inches thick in others it is flat or wedge shaped The flat headed pachycephalosaurs are usually regarded as distinct species or even families but they may be juveniles of dome headed adults The domes were often surrounded by nodes and or spikes There is evidence of head butting in pachycephalosaurs Of domes studied percent showed signs of healed injuries all consistent with combative behavior The pathologies included pitting where the bone had become infected from wounds that originated in the skin These findings suggest that pachycephalosaurids may have been using their heads for both display and defence as many modern animals do
