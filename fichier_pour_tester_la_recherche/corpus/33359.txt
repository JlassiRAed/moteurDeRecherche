 Neurotransmitters are chemical messengers They send information between neuron s by crossing a synapse Electrical signals are not able to cross the gap between most neurons They are changed into chemical signals to cross the gap Neurotransmitters act mostly on chemical synapse s Once they reach the next neuron they are absorbed The neuron then changes this chemical signal back into an electrical signal called an action potential The action potential passes across the next neuron and to the next synapse Many neurotransmitters are made from amino acid s which are part of your diet and it takes only a few steps to convert them Neurotransmitters play a major role in shaping everyday life and functions Scientists do not yet know exactly how many neurotransmitters exist but more than chemical messengers have been identified Each neurotransmitter has a different function For example dopamine is used in reward and pleasure and noradrenaline is used in an animal s Fight or flight response fight or flight response Neurotransmitters also regulate the passing of messages This is because an action potential must be a certain strength before the neurotransmitters are released The strength required to release the neurotransmitter is called a threshold The most common transmitter is glutamate which is excitatory at well over of the synapses in the human brain The next most prevalent is called GABA which inhibits at more than of the synapses that do not use glutamate Neurotransmitters are transported within neurons by small sacks called vesicles When these vesciles come into contact with the neuron s cell membrane it opens This releases the neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft
