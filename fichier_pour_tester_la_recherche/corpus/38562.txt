The Protea is the national flower of South Africa The variety in plant size habit flower size and colour of the genus Protea was the reason it was named after the Greek god Proteus who could change his shape at will The flower bud of Protea cynaroides looks remarkably like the globe artichoke vegetable with the Latin name of Cynara scolymus and this led the botanist Linnaeus to give it the species name cynaroides
