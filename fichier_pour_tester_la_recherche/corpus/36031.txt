 Mohs scale of mineral hardness is named after the scientist Friedrich Mohs who invented a scale of hardness based on the ability of one mineral to scratch another Rocks are made up of one or more minerals According to the scale Talc is the softest it can be scratched by all other materials Gypsum is harder it can scratch talc but not calcite which is even harder The hardness of a mineral is mainly controlled by the strength of the bonding between the atom s and partly by the size of the atoms It is a measure of the resistance of the mineral to scratching The Mohs scale is for natural minerals For manufactured products other measures of hardness are better NDT Resource Center hardness Diamond is always at the top of the scale being the hardest mineral There are ten minerals in Mohs scale talc gypsum calcite fluorite apatite orthoclase quartz topaz corundum and for last and hardest diamond Because the Mohs scale was made long ago it is not exactly correct for example several minerals are now known to be harder than the diamond The Mohs scale may not be perfect but field geologist s still find it very useful
