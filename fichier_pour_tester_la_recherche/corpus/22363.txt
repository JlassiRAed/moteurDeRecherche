 Agilodocodon was a shrew sized docodont from the Middle Jurassic It is the earliest known Arboreal tree climbing mammal like therapsid Agilodocodon scansorius was about centimeters from head to tail and weighed about grams This interpretation is questioned by another palaeontologist He thinks Agilodocodon s teeth are quite different from the modern sap eating monkeys and the long thin lower jaw seems too weak for gnawing tree bark
