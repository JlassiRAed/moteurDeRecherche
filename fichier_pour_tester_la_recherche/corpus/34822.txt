 Plasma is a state of matter The three other common states of matter are solids liquids and gases so plasma is sometimes called the fourth state of matter Plasma is created by adding energy to a gas so that some of its electrons leave its atoms This is called ionization It results in negatively charged electron s and positively charged ion s Unlike the other states of matter the charged particles in a plasma will react strongly to electric and magnetic fields If a plasma loses heat the ions will re form into a gas emitting the energy which had caused them to ionize Over of the matter in the Observable universe visible universe is believed to be plasma When the atom s in a gas are broken up the pieces are called electron s and ion s Because they have an electric charge they are pulled together or pushed apart by Electricity electric fields and magnetic field s This makes a plasma act differently than a gas For example magnetic fields can be used to hold a plasma but not to hold a gas Plasma is a better Electrical conductor conductor of electricity than copper Plasma is usually very hot because it takes very high temperature s to break the bonds between electrons and the nuclei of the atoms Sometimes plasmas can have very high pressure like in star s Stars are mostly made of plasma Plasmas can also have very low pressure like in outer space On earth lightning makes plasma Artificial uses of plasma include fluorescent light bulbs neon signs and plasma display s used for television or computer screens as well as plasma lamps and globes which are a popular children s toy and room decoration Scientists are experimenting with plasma to make a new kind of nuclear power called nuclear fusion fusion which would be much better and safer than Nuclear fission ordinary nuclear power and would produce much less radioactivity radioactive waste
