An artesian aquifer is an underground layer which holds groundwater under pressure This causes the water level in the well to rise to a point where the pressure is equal to the weight of water putting it under pressure This type of water well well is called an artesian well Water may even reach the ground surface if the natural pressure is high enough in which case the well is called a flowing artesian well An aquifer is a geologic layer which can hold water such as sand and gravel limestone or sandstone through which water flows and is stored An artesian aquifer is trapped between rocks or clay which causes the pressure Water returns to the aquifers when the water table at its recharge zone is at a higher elevation than the head of the water well well Fossil water aquifers can also be artesian if they are under sufficient pressure from the surrounding rocks This is similar to how many newly tapped oil well s are pressurized
