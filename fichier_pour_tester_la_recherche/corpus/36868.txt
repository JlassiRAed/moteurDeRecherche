A list of endangered languages In order to judge if a language is actually endangered the number of speakers is less important than the distribution among age cohorts There may be mother tongue speakers of the Breton language over years of age but fewer than under years of age thus it is likely Breton will die out in the next half century On the other hand while there are Ladin language speakers left almost all children still learn it as their mother tongue thus Ladin is not endangered in the st century
