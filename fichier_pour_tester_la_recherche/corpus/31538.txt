 Defence against herbivory describes plant defences to avoid being eaten There are many adaptation s which improve the fitness survival and reproduction of plants by reducing the impact of herbivore s Plants use several strategies to defend against damage caused by herbivores Many plants produce chemical s which change the behaviour growth or survival of herbivores These chemical defences can act as repellents or toxin s to herbivores or reduce plant digestibility Some plants encourage the presence of predator natural enemies of herbivores which in turn protect the plant Other defensive strategies used by plants include escaping or avoiding herbivores in time or in place They may grow where plants are not easily found or got at by herbivores They may grow when herbivores are not around Herbivores may get diverted towards non essential parts or a plant may be able to recover from the damage caused by herbivory Each type of defence can be either constitutive Plants can and do react to damage Boyd Jade A bit touchy Plants insect defenses activated by touch Rice University Historically insects have been the most significant herbivores and the evolution of land plants is closely associated with the evolution of insects While most plant defences are directed against insects other defences have evolved that are aimed at vertebrate herbivores such as bird s and mammal s The study of plant defences against herbivory is important not only from an evolutionary view point but also because these defences can be used in agriculture including human and livestock food sources
