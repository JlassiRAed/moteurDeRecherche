 Homeostasis The most important example of homeostasis is life Animals keep their body in a stable condition They do so by wikt regulation regulating their inner equilibrium For example they adjust their pH temperature amount of oxygen or carbon dioxide in the blood and so on In living things the study of how they keep in a stable condition is called physiology Mostly our physiology works unconscious ly throughout life We have many feedback systems which adjust our physiology so that we stay alive These systems are self organising and do not need to be learnt They are Heritability inherited The concept was described by Claude Bernard Constancy in an open system such as our bodies is done by mechanisms which maintain this constancy Cannon based this on insights into the ways by which steady states such as glucose concentrations body temperature and acids and bases acid base balance were regulated To keep a steady state condition any change automatically meets with factors that resist change An increase in blood salt results in thirst as the body attempts to dilute the concentration of salt in the extracellular fluid The regulating system doing homeostasis has a number of cooperating mechanisms which act simultaneously or successively Blood sugar is regulated by insulin glucagons and other hormones that control its release from the liver or its uptake by the tissues Examples of homeostasis In mammal s the main organs involved with homeostasis are The hypothalamus and pituitary gland the lung s the skin the muscle s the kidney s the liver and pancreas The brain is also central to homeostasis It controls behaviour and the basic function of behaviour is to support life by taking action
