 Stereochemistry is the study of how molecule s are affected by the way their atom s are arranged in space Using stereochemistry chemists can work out the relationships between different molecules that are made up from the same atoms They can also study the effect on the physics physical or biology biological properties these relationships give molecules When these relationships influence the Reactivity reactivity of the molecules it is called dynamic stereochemistry In chemistry some molecule s have more than one isomer This means that molecules can have different forms even though all the forms made up of the same atoms There are two kinds of isonomers These molecules look almost identical except that one molecule is the mirror image of the other In most chemical bond s the atoms of a molecule free to move around without breaking the bonds When a molecule has a double bond or a ring structure the molecule can be sorted into different isomers These are molecules with the same chemical structure but different forms The study of stereochemical problems covers the entire range of Organic chemistry organic Inorganic chemistry inorganic Biochemistry biological Physical chemistry physical and Supramolecular chemistry supramolecular chemistries
