 Gamma ray bursts are flashes of gamma ray s from extremely energetic explosions They have been seen in distant galaxies They are the most Luminosity luminous Electromagnetism electromagnetic events known to occur in the universe Bursts can last from milliseconds to several minutes although a typical burst lasts a few seconds The initial burst is usually followed by a longer lived afterglow emitted at longer wavelengths Most GRBs are a narrow beam of intense radiation released during a supernova as a huge rapidly spinning star collapses to form a black hole A subclass of GRBs seem to come from a different process perhaps the merger of binary star binary neutron stars The sources of most GRBs are billion s of light year s away from Earth This suggests the explosions are extremely energetic a typical burst releases as much energy in a few seconds as the Sun will in its entire billion year lifetime cite journal cite journal All observed GRBs have come from outside the Milky Way galaxy Similar phenomena soft gamma repeater flares are associated with magnetar s within the Milky Way It has been suggested that a gamma ray burst in the Milky Way could cause a mass extinction on Earth cite journal No such case is known
