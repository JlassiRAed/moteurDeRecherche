We use time to sequence events to compare their durations and the intervals between them and to quantity quantify the speed at which objects move and things change To measure time we can use anything that repeats itself regularly One example is the dawn of a new day Even in ancient times people developed calendar s to keep track of the number of days in a year They also developed sundial s that used the moving shadows cast by the sun through the day to measure times smaller than a day Today highly accurate clock s can measure times less than a billionth of a second The study of time measurement is horology The Systeme Internationale SI unit of time is one second written as s In Einstein ian physics time and space can be combined into a single concept See space time continuum
