 The magnetic field is the area around a magnet in which there is magnetic force Moving electric charge s can make magnetic fields Magnetic fields can usually be seen by magnetic flux line s At all times the direction of the magnetic field is shown by the direction of the magnetic flux lines The strength of a magnet has to do with the spaces between the magnetic flux lines The closer the flux lines are to each other the stronger the magnet is The farther away they are the weaker The flux lines can be seen by placing iron filings over a magnet The iron filings move and arrange into the lines Magnetic fields give power to other particle s that are touching the magnetic field In physics the magnetic field is a field that passes through space and which makes a magnetic force move electric charges and magnetic dipoles Magnetic fields are around electric currents magnetic dipoles and changing electric fields When placed in a magnetic field magnetic dipole s are in one line with their axes to be parallel with the field lines as can be seen when iron filings are in the presence of a magnet Magnetic fields also have their own energy and momentum with an energy density proportional to the square of the field intensity The magnetic field is measured in the units of tesla There are some notable specific kinds of the magnetic field For the physics of magnetic materials see magnetism and magnet and more specifically diamagnetism For magnetic fields made by changing electric fields see electromagnetism The electric field and the magnetic field are wikt component components of the electromagnetic field The law of electromagnetism was founded by Michael Faraday
