An unconformity is a wikt gap gap in the sequence of Rock rocks in a geologic column It is a buried erosion surface separating two rock strata of different ages It shows that sediment deposition was broken for a time usually because the land was above sea level at that time Usually the older layer was exposed to erosion for some time before deposition of the younger However the term is used to describe any break in the Sedimentary rock sedimentary record Many millions of years may separate the rocks above and below the discontinuity James Hutton found examples of unconformity in Scotland at Jedburgh in and at Siccar Point in The rocks above an unconformity are younger than the rocks beneath An unconformity represents time during which no sediments were preserved in the region The local record for that time interval is missing and geologists must use other clues to discover that part of the geologic history of that area The interval of geologic time not represented is called a hiatus
