A t test is a statistical hypothesis test People use it when they want to compare a mean of a measurement of two groups A and B They want to decide if the mean in group A is different to the theoretical value or to the mean in group B For example pretend there are two groups of people One group exercises a lot and the other doesn t Do the people who exercise tend to live longer than those who don t Then the property of interest is the average life time Is the average life time of people who exercise different to the average life time of people who don t A t test can help answer this question The t test is used when the property s variance in the groups is unknown When people want to do the t test they have to calculate the variance from the sample This calculated variance is almost always different to the true variance in the group The t test was created to care about this difference
