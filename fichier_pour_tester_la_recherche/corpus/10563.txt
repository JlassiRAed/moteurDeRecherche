 Electron transfer chains are the cellular mechanisms used for getting energy from sunlight in photosynthesis They also occur in redox reactions such as the oxidation of sugars in cellular respiration In aerobic respiration each molecule of glucose leads to about molecules of ATP being produced by the ETC This is by far the most productive part of respiration
