 Cold fusion is nuclear fusion at room temperature and normal pressure Nuclear fusion is the process by which many nucleus and during that process energy is released Some scientists hope that this may be Earth s future energy source but most scientists do not agree is needed With this energy the atoms are pushed together which are repelled by the electrostatic force But once this force is overcome and the nuclei are pushed close enough together another much more powerful force will take over the strong nuclear force It only operates at short distances so when the nuclei are close enough they attract each other because of the strong nuclear force which is stronger than the electrostatic force It is hoped that the energy released by cold fusion is much greater than the energy used to push the atoms together In two scientists Stanley Pons and Martin Fleischmann published a paper in Nature an important science journal claiming to have created cold fusion This was a very important story at the time Other scientists were not able to repeat their experiment s This is why cold fusion is not generally accepted by scientists at the moment Several dozen scientists are still working on cold fusion research They publish in peer reviewed journals and other academic sources regularly but most are not convinced
