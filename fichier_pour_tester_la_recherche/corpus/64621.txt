 Ox Mountain is a story by the Chinese philosopher Mencius In his time this mountain was in very bad shape and everybody knew how it looked Here is the story Mencius argued that bad human natures were produced just as the bad condition of Ox Mountain had been produced so the answer to bad humans was to protect and nurture them from birth He also thought that punishment does not do much good It does not cure the root of the problem
