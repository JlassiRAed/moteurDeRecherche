 Drosophila simulans is a species of fruit fly closely related to Drosophila melanogaster D melanogaster It was discovered by the fly geneticist Alfred Sturtevant in when he noticed that the flies used in Thomas Hunt Morgan s laboratory at the Columbia University were actually two distinct species Drosophila melanogaster D melanogaster and D simulans Males differ in the external genitalia while trained observers can separate females using colour characteristics D melanogaster females crossed to D simulans males produce sterile F females and no F males The reciprocal cross produces sterile F males and no female progeny D simulans was found later to be closely related to two island endemism endemics Drosophila sechellia and Drosophila mauritiana D simulans will mate with these sister species to form fertile females and sterile males a fact that has made D simulans an important model organism for research into speciation
