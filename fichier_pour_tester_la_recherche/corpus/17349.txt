A proton is part of an atom They are found in the Nucleus is made up of an electron moving around a proton Most of the mass of this atom is in the proton which is almost times heavier than the electron Protons and neutrons make up the nucleus of every other kind of atom In any one chemical element element the number of protons is always the same An atom s atomic number is equal to the number of protons in that atom Protons are made of quarks One down quark has a Electromagnetism charge of and two up quarks have a charge of each This adds to a charge of A proton has a very small mass The mass of the proton is about one atomic mass unit The mass of the neutron is also about one atomic mass unit The size of a proton is determined by the vibration of the quarks that are in it and these quarks effectively form a cloud This means that a proton is not so much a hard ball as an area that contains quarks
