 Dimetrodon was a pelycosaur Dimetrodon walked on four legs and had a tall curved skull with large teeth of different sizes set along the jaws Most fossils have been found in the southwestern United States from red beds in Texas and Oklahoma The largest known species of Dimetrodon is D angelensis at Dimetrodon was a carnivore probably the top predator in its environment Its main feature is the large sail on its back formed by elongated spines extending upwards from the vertebrae The spines would be joined by epidermis skin The general opinion of palaeontologist s is that it was a homoiotherm temperature regulating device Florides G A et al Natural environment and thermal behaviour of Dimetrodon limbatus Journal of Thermal Biology signalling In which case the skin would be coloured This of course is supposition but it does make sense of the animal s most extraordinary feature In evolutionary terms Dimetrodon was a synapsid a line of land animals which eventually gave rise to the mammals It was not on the direct line of descent Benson R J Interrelationships of basal synapsids cranial and postcranial morphological partitions suggest different topologies Journal of Systematic Paleontology but a good example of the evolutionary grade typical of Permian synapsids
