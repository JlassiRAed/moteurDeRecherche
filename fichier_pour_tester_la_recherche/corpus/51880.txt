 Polar moment of inertia is a measure of a circular beam s ability to resist Torsion torsion It is required to calculate the twist of an beam subjected to a torque It is analogous to the area moment of inertia which characterizes a beam s ability to resist bending and is required to calculate displacement The larger the polar moment of inertia the less the beam will twist when subjected to a given torque The polar moment of inertia must not be confused with the moment of inertia which characterizes an object s angular acceleration due to a torque Unlike other forms of inertia polar moment of inertia has units of length
