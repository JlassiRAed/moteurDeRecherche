 Radio astronomy is astronomy which studies Astronomical object celestial objects at radio frequency radio frequencies The first detection of radio waves from an astronomical object was made in the s Karl Jansky found radiation coming from the Milky Way Later other sources of radio emission were found These include star s and galaxy galaxies as well as entirely new classes of objects such as Radio galaxy radio galaxies quasar s pulsar s and Astrophysical maser masers The discovery of the cosmic microwave background radiation evidence for the Big Bang Big Bang theory was made through radio astronomy Radio astronomy is done using large Antenna to distinguish small details of an object The resolving power of an interferometer is set by the distance between its components not the size of its components
