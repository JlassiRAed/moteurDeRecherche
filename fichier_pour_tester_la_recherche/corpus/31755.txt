A phase change is the process by which forms of matter are altered For example when a solid melts and becomes a liquid it goes through a phase change When a solid changes into a gas it is called sublimation When a gas changes into to liquid it is called condensation When a liquid changes into a solid it is called solidification When a gas changes into a solid it is called deposition When a liquid changes into gas it is called evaporation As the states of matter change from solid to liquid to gas respectively their composition changes as well For example in a solid the chemical bond bonds are stronger than hydrogen bonds That allows the solid substance to have a definite volume and shape However when heat is added to the solid and it melts to become a liquid the bonds are considerably weaker and in water are simply hydrogen bond s A liquid has a definite volume but not a definite shape and it thus takes the shape of the container in which it is When more heat is added the liquid substance evaporates and becomes a gas which has no bonds at all A gas is simply a formless collection of particles that tends to expand in all directions at the same time in order to occupy its full container If a gas is not confined the space between the particles will continue to increase A gas has neither a definite volume nor a definite shape In this pattern solid to liquid to gas heat is being added in order to provoke the phase change In the other direction gas to liquid to solid heat is being released through the phase change It often helps to think of an ice cube when thinking of phase changes An ice cube is a solid and when heated up it becomes liquid water When heated up some more it becomes water vapor which is a gas
