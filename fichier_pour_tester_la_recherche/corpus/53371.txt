A Neural network is an artificial system made up of virtual abstractions of neuron cells Based on the human brain neural networks are used to solve computational problems by imitating the way neurons are fired or activated in the brain During a computation many computing cells work in parallel to produce a result This is usually seen as one of the possible ways artificial intelligence can work Most neural networks can still operate if one or more of the processing cells fail Neural networks can learn by themselves an ability which sets them apart from normal computers Today s computers cannot do anything they are not programmed to do
