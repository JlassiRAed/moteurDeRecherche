 Deuterium is an isotope of hydrogen the first Chemical element element Deuterium has one proton and one neutron Hydrogen does not have a neutron only a proton Another isotope of hydrogen tritium has two neutrons The Chemistry chemical symbol for Deuterium is H but D is also used often Two deuterium atoms combined with an oxygen atom is sometimes called heavy water This is because it is like water but heavier because deuterium has one more neutron in its nucleus Heavy water is sometimes used in nuclear reactor nuclear reactors It is also used as a solvent for NMR spectroscopy This is because it will dissolve the sample like normal water but it will not be detected by the magnet in an H NMR
