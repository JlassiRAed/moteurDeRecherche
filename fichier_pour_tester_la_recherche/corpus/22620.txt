An extrasolar planet is a natural planet in a planetary system outside our own solar system In estimates of the number of terrestrial planet s in the Milky Way ranged from at least billion An analysis was done of planet candidates gathered by the Kepler space observatory Earlier work suggested that there are at least billion planets of all types in our galaxy an average of at least one per star There are also planets that orbit brown dwarf s and free floating planets that orbit the galaxy directly just as the stars do It is unclear whether either type should be called a planet
