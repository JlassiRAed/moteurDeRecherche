The known plaintext attack secret key Encrypted file archives such as ZIP file format ZIP are very prone to this attack For example an attacker with an encrypted ZIP file needs only one unencrypted file from the archive which forms the known plaintext Then using some publicly available software they can instantly calculate the key required to decrypt the entire archive Classical cipher s are typically susceptible to known plaintext attack For example a Caesar cipher can be solved using a single letter of corresponding plaintext and ciphertext to decrypt entirely
