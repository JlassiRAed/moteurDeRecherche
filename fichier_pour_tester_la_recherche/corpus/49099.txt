 Titration is a type of Quantitative research quantitative Analytical chemistry chemical analysis It is used to work out the unknown concentration of a known substance It makes the use of two main chemical apparatus namely pipette and burette External indicators like phenolphthalein or methyl orange and internal indicators like KMnO are used to mark the end point of titration A known concentration and volume of a reagent called the titrant or titrator is added to a known volume of another reagent the analyte or titrand This is done slowly from a burette until the end point is reached The volume added before the end point is reached is noted Because one of the solutions the titrant has a known concentration that of the other the titrand can be calculated Professionals now use a pH meter which is potentiometer with an electrode whose potential depends on the amount of H ions in the solution The pH of the solution is measured throughout the titration more accurately than with an indicator At the endpoint there is a sudden change in the measured pH Since volume measurements play a key role in titration it is known as volumetric analysis as well as quantitative analysis
