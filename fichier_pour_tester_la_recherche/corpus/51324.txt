 Nuclear fusion is the process of making a single heavy Nucleus nuclei This process is called a nuclear reaction It releases a large amount of energy FusEdWeb The nucleus made by fusion is heavier than either of the starting nuclei However it is not as heavy as the combination of the original mass of the starting nuclei This lost mass is changed into lots of energy This is shown in Einstein Einstein s famous E mc E mc equation Fusion happens in the middle of star stars like the Sun Hydrogen atoms are fused together to make helium This releases lots of energy This energy powers the heat and light of the star Not all Chemical element elements can be joined Heavier elements are less easily joined than lighter ones Iron cannot fuse with other atoms This is what causes star s to die Star s join all of their atoms together to make heavier atoms of different types until they start to make iron The iron nucleus cannot fuse with other nuclei The reactions stop The star eventually will cool down and Stellar evolution die On Earth it is very difficult to start nuclear fusion reactions that release more energy than is needed to start the reaction The only successful approach so far has been in nuclear weapons The hydrogen bomb uses an atomic bomb in order to start fusion reactions Scientists and engineers have been trying to find a safe and working way of wikt control controlling and wikt contain containing fusion reactions that can generate electricity They still have many challenges to overcome before fusion power can be used as a clean source of energy
