In fluid dynamics drag force which tends to slow the movement of an object through a liquid or gas As a moving object pushes the liquid or gas out of its way the fluid pushes back on the object This drag force is always opposite to the object s motion and unlike friction between solid surfaces the drag force increases as the object moves faster Air resistance also known as drag is a force that is caused by air the force acts in the opposite direction to an object moving through the air It is where air particles hit the front of the object slowing it down The more surface area the more air particles hit it and the greater the resistance For example a truck with a flat front will experience high air resistance while a sports car with a streamlined shape will experience lower air resistance allowing the car to go faster This is why airplane s and other fast machines are streamline d A Snowflake structure snowflake falls more slowly than does a drop of water of the same weight Drag can affect the quickest falling speed of an object The higher the drag the slower the object falls
