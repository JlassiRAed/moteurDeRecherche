The Little River forms the western boundary of Cook County Georgia Georgia It is dammed at Reed Bingham State Park forming a lake for fishing swimming and recreation There are two interesting structures along the river near the Cook and Brooks County line A few years ago the Adel News ran a story about a stone bridge over the river It still stands and was built entirely from poured cement It was abandoned around when the road took a different path About three miles south another bridge with its middle section missing crosses what looks like a small pond
