 Similarity is an idea in geometry It means that two polygons line segments or other figures have the same shape Similar objects do not need to have the same size Two shapes are similar if their angles have the same measure and their sides are Proportionality proportional Two circles squares or line segments are always similar Triangles are special in similarity This is because triangles can be similar if only their angles are equal or only their sides are proportional All other polygons must meet both of the conditions Similarity is very similar to congruence Congruent shapes have the same sides and angles In fact all shapes that are congruent to each other are also similar
