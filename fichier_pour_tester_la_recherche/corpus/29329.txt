A plasmid is a DNA molecule that is separate from the chromosome chromosomal DNA and that can replicate independently The term plasmid was first introduced by the United States American molecular biology molecular biologist Joshua Lederberg in Plasmids are double stranded and in many cases circular Plasmids usually occur naturally in bacterium bacteria but are sometimes found in eukaryote eukaryotic organisms Plasmid size varies from to over Base pair kilobase pairs cell can range from one to thousands Plasmids are often associated with bacterial conjugation conjugation a mechanism of horizontal gene transfer Plasmids are transferable genetic elements or replicon domains Archaea Bacteria and Eukarya Unlike viruses plasmids are naked DNA and do not encode genes necessary to encase the genetic material for transfer to a new host Plasmid host to host transfer requires direct mechanical transfer by bacterial conjugation conjugation or changes in host gene expression allowing the intentional uptake of the genetic element by transformation transformation Microbial transformation with plasmid DNA is neither parasitic nor symbiotic in nature since each implies the presence of an independent species living in a commensal or detrimental state with the host organism Rather plasmids provide a mechanism for horizontal gene transfer within a population of microbes and may provide a selective advantage under a given environmental state Plasmids may carry genes that provide resistance to naturally occurring antibiotics in a competitive environmental niche or alternatively the proteins produced may act as toxins under similar circumstances Plasmids also can provide bacteria with an ability to fix elemental nitrogen or to degrade difficult organic compounds This may provide an advantage under conditions of nutrient deprivation
