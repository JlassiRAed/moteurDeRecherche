 Carlito Carlito Cephalopachus Tarsius The tarsiers are prosimian Tarsiers have huge eyes and long feet and catch the insects by jumping at them During the night they wait quietly listening for the sound of an insect moving nearby They live in trees and are entirely nocturnal They are the only primates which are wholly carnivorous They mainly eat insects but some are also known to eat birds and snakes Tarsiers can catch prey like birds even if they are in motion as the tarsiers jump from tree to tree to catch their prey
