A Field programmable gate array is an electronic component used to build reconfigurable digital circuits That means that an FPGA is different from a logic gate because a logic gate has a fixed function In contrast an FPGA has an undefined function at the time of manufacture Before the FPGA can be used in a circuit it must be programmed that is reconfigured FPGAs are integrated circuits in the category of en Programmable logic device programmable logic devices or PLDs FPGAs are the highest performance most flexible and also the most expensive of the PLD types A drawback of FPGAs compared to other PLDs is that they do not remember their design when the power is removed An FPGA therefore needs a separate configuration memory chip that holds the FPGA design When the power is giving back to the FPGA a fixed part of the FPGA reads the configuration from the configuration memory chip After the FPGA is configured it will be able to do the function it was giving by the design An FPGA is different from a microprocessor or microcontroller An FPGA in its basic form is not able to run software Only when the FPGA is given a configuration that contains a processor architecture it has the ability to run software FPGA manufacturers provide engineering software for Windows and sometimes also Linux to develop designs for FPGAs The design is commonly written in human readable computer files called a Hardware Description Language The most popular are VHDL and Verilog Hardware description languages are strongly comparable to programming languages But the intention of HDLs is to design digital logic circuits while programming languages design software The FPGA engineering software has to translate the abstract HDL code into the logic elements available in the selected FPGA That is called logic synthesis Then a process of place and route is done to position the logic elements in the FPGA The result is a bitfile that can be programmed into the FPGA or the configuration memory This is usually done with a USB programmer connected to the JTAG port of the FPGA Because the FPGA is an integrated circuit an FPGA manufacturer can decide to add other commonly used integrated circuit components These fixed parts are called cores These are for example Ethernet controllers or even a complete processor architecture For different market segments such as defense medical communications and robotics the FPGA manufacturer tries to add the most valuable set of these additional cores
