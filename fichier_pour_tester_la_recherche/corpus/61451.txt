A space observatory is any instrument in outer space which is used for observation of distant objects Planets stars galaxies and other outer space objects may be viewed and recorded This category does not include observatories in space which are pointed toward the earth for the purpose of reconnaissance and other types of information gathering All observation of space from Earth is filtered through the Earth s atmosphere The atmosphere filters and distorts what is seen and recorded Space based astronomy is vital for electromagnetic radiation frequency ranges outside the optical and radio windows For example X ray astronomy is nearly impossible when done from the Earth It has reached its present importance in astronomy due to orbiting X ray telescopes Infrared and ultraviolet are also largely blocked by the atmosphere Most space observatories are in low Earth orbit
