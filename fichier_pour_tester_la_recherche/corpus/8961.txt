In mathematics the derivative is a way to represent rate of change that is the amount by which a function is changing at one given point For functions that act on the real number s it is the slope of the tangent line at a point on a graph The derivative is often written using dy over dx meaning the difference in y divided by the difference in x The d s are not variable and therefore cannot be cancelled out
