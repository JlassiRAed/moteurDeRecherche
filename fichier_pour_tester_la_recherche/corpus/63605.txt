 Cementation is what makes rocks solid It is the process where grains of sediment get stuck together It is a chemical process and the cement is a precipitation precipitate which crystallises in the spaces between the matrix of grains Silica are the most common types of cement Ions carried in groundwater precipitate to form new crystalline material in sediment pores this is how sediment becomes rock The new pore filling minerals form bridges between original sediment grains thereby binding them together So sand becomes sandstone and gravel becomes conglomerate conglomerate Cementation occurs mainly below the water table Large volumes of pore water must pass through sediment pores for new mineral cements to crystallize and so millions of years are generally required to complete the cementation process Sedimentation does not always occur Many quarry quarries used for sand and gravel have them as loose particles and stones just as if they came from a present day beach In England most of these quarries are from beds laid down in the Jurassic million years ago By chance the conditions for cementation have never occurred there
