 Jerk is the change in the acceleration of an wikt object object Mathematically jerk is the derivative surge or lurch Jerk is a vector and there is no word for its scalar value The jerk is measured in metre s per second cubed Yank can be thought as a Force force However when an object is moving near the speed of light a force is often written as the derivative of momentum In this case Yank is the rate of change of the derivative of momentum
