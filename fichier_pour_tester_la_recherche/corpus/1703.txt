 Topology is the study of how spaces are organized how the objects are structured in terms of position It also studies how spaces are connected It is divided into algebraic topology differential topology and geometric topology Topology has sometimes been called rubber sheet geometry because in topology of dimensions there is no difference between a circle and a square The spaces studied in topology are called topological space s They vary from familiar manifold s to some very exotic constructions
