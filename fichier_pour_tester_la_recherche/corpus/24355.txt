 Space in everyday language is something that we all know It is measured in the three dimension s of distance length width and height In modern physics space is a boundless four dimensional continuum known as spacetime Disagreement exist about whether it is an entity It may be just a relationship between entities or part of a concept ual framework The standard space interval called a metre is defined as the distance traveled by light in a vacuum during a time interval of about of a second Before Einstein s work on relativistic physics time and space were viewed as independent dimensions Einstein s discoveries have shown that due to relativity of motion motion space and time can be Mathematics mathematically combined into space time
