 Westerlund away from Earth It is the most massive compact young star cluster known in the entire Local Group Local Group of galaxies It was discovered by Bengt Westerlund in cite journalThe cluster contains a large number of rare evolved high mass stars including yellow hypergiant s red supergiant s Wolf Rayet star s a luminous blue variable many OB star OB supergiants and an unusual supergiant Be star sgB e star which may be the remnant of a recent Stellar collision stellar merger Westerlund is believed to have formed in a single burst of star formation so the stars have similar ages and compositions Apart from hosting some of the most massive and least understood stars in the galaxy Westerlund is useful as an example of a relatively nearby so easier to observe super star cluster to help astronomers find out what happens in extragalactic super star clusters
