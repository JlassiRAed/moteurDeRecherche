The chloralkali process is a process used to create sodium hydroxide chlorine and hydrogen from sodium chloride and water It is normally conducted in a wikt tank tank separated by a membrane although there are other methods such as using mercury If potassium chloride or calcium chloride is used instead potassium hydroxide and calcium hydroxide are produced When the membrane is not in place hypochlorite s are formed If it is heated chlorate s are formed The process is fueled by electrolysis It can be done in the laboratory
