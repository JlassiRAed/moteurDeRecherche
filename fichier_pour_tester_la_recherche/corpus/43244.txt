 The white spot at s is the pole of the zeta function the black spots on the negative real axis and on the critical line Re are its zeros In mathematics the Riemann zeta function is a prominent function function of great significance in number theory It is named after Germany German mathematician Bernhard Riemann It is so important because of its relation to the prime number theorem distribution of prime numbers It also has applications in other areas such as physics probability theory and applied statistics When using mathematical symbols to describe the Riemann zeta function instead of explaining it using English it is explained like this s must be a complex number meaning that it can involve the square root of or i However because this doesn t work for numbers where R Leonhard Euler discovered the first results about this function in the eighteenth century It is named after Bernhard Riemann who wrote about it in the memoir On the Number of Primes Less Than a Given Quantity published in The Riemann hypothesis is a conjecture about the distribution of the Root of a function zeros of the Riemann zeta function Many mathematicians consider the Riemann hypothesis to be the most important unsolved problem in pure mathematics
