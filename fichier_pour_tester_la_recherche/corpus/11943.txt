 Luminosity is a measure of wikt brightness brightness Brightness is how much light is given off In astronomy the total amount of energy emission emitted by a star or other astronomical object is its luminosity It is measured in joules per second which are equal to watt s A watt is one unit of power Just as a light bulb is measured in watts the Sun can also be measured in watts The sun gives off This number is known as sol the symbol for which is There are other ways to describe luminosity The most common is apparent magnitude which is how bright an object looks to an observer on Earth It only applies to light that is Visible light visible wavelengths Apparent magnitude is contrasted with absolute magnitude which is an object s intrinsic brightness at visible wavelengths irrespective of distance The apparent magnitude is the less for objects more than light years away If it is necessary to talk about the total power output across Electromagnetic spectrum all wavelengths that is called bolometric magnitude
