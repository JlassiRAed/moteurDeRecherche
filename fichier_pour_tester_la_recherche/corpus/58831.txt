 Gram positive no outer membrane Actinobacteria Firmicutes Tenericutes Gram negative outer membrane present Aquificae Bacteroidetes Chlorobi Chlamydiae Verrucomicrobia Deinococcus Thermus Fusobacteria Gemmatimonadetes Nitrospirae Proteobacteria Spirochaete s Synergistetes Acidobacteria Chloroflexi Chrysiogenetes Cyanobacteria Deferribacteraceae Deferribacteres Dictyoglomi Fibrobacteres Planctomycetes Thermodesulfobacteria Thermotogae Bacteria are very small organism s They are prokaryotic microorganisms Bacterial cells do not have a nucleus and most have no organelles with membranes around them Most have a cell wall They do have DNA and their biochemistry is basically the same as other living things Almost all bacteria are so tiny they can only be seen through a microscope Bacteria are made up of one cell so they are a kind of unicellular organism They are among the simplest single celled organisms on Earth and were one of the earliest forms of life They include a number of extremophile s which live in extreme habitats There are probably more individual bacteria than any other sort of organism on the planet Most bacteria live in the ground or in water but many live inside or on the skin of other organisms including humans There are about ten times as many bacterial cells as human cells in each of our bodies Some bacteria can cause disease s but others help us in everyday activities like digesting food Some even work for us in factories producing cheese and yogurt The founder of bacteriology was a Germans German biologist called Ferdinand Cohn He published the first biological classification of bacteria based on their appearance
