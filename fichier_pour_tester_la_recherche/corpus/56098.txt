 Molecular vibrations are one of three different kinds of motion for molecule s that include translational motion A vibrational motion for a molecule is when the bonds between atom s within a molecule move Think of the atoms as round balls that are attached by a spring that can stretch back and forth An example of this motion is stretching the simplest example of a vibration for a molecule and occurs between just two atoms Some examples of molecules that are like this include hydrogen H
