 Wiswesser Line Notation also referred to as WLN was the first line notation that precisely describes complex molecule s The notation is simple so that trained chemists as well as computers can translate it The keypunch was the main data entry device when WLN was developed Keypunches could only type capital letters numbers and a few special characters So the symbols used in WLN were limited so that they could be stored on punched cards
