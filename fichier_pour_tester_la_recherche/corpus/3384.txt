 Thomas Hunt Morgan was an United States American genetics geneticist and Embryology embryologist Morgan took his PhD at Johns Hopkins University in and researched embryology while at Bryn Mawr College After the rediscovery of Mendelian inheritance in Morgan switched his research to the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster In E B Wilson invited Morgan to join him at Columbia University This move freed Morgan to focus fully on experimental work In his famous Fly Room at Columbia Morgan was able to show that gene s are carried on chromosome s and are the mechanical basis of heredity These discoveries formed the basis of the modern science of genetics Morgan moved to California in to head the Division of Biology at the California Institute of Technology Research was focused on genetics and evolution experimental embryology physiology biophysics and biochemistry He was given the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in It was the first one given for genetics for his discoveries concerning the role played by the chromosome in heredity Morgan s early work with Drosophila was on the associations known as coupling and repulsion discovered by English workers in and using the Sweet Pea These were in reality the same phenomenon which was later called Genetic linkage linkage Morgan s first papers dealt with the demonstration of sex linkage of the gene for white eyes in the fly the male fly being sex chromosome heterogametic During his distinguished career Morgan wrote books and scientific papers and as a result of his work Drosophila became the main model organism in genetics The Division of Biology he started at the California Institute of Technology produced seven Nobel Prize winners
