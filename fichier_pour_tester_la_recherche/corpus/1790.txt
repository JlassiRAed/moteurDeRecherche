 Haploid is the term used when a cell has half the usual number of chromosome s A normal eukaryote organism is composed of diploid cells one set of chromosomes from each parent However after meiosis the number of chromosomes in gamete s is halved That is the haploid condition In human humans the diploid number of chromosomes is This is a special genetic system called haplodiploidy Some plants and animals are polyploid with more than two sets of chromosomes For example one species of wheat is hexaploid with six sets of chromosomes although other species of wheat have only two sets Because so many organisms are diploid it can become confusing whether haploid refers to one set of chromosomes or more than one The special term monoploid can be used it means one set of chromosomes
