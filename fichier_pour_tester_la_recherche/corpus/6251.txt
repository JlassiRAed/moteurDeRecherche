 en electroshock weapon TASERING stands for Talking about Simple English Really Is Not Grueling The English Wikipedia has a lot of regular contributors and a new discussion if it is started in the right place can get comments from others in minutes But Simple English Wikipedia is a very tiny wiki and a very small community in comparison with a lot less regular contributors Because of this discussions can get ignored for months So the main idea of this rule is this if you see a poor discussion all alone that nobody wants to play with post a comment We all know that typing can take a heck of a lot out of you sometimes but if you have something to say on the matter don t let the discussion suffer because of your laziness Many brilliant ideas that could really improve this project are being ignored
