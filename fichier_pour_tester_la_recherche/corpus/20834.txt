The Nintendo Virtual Boy was a mostly portable game Video game console console which had two screens that showed only red and black graphics To use the system one had to put one s face close to the system so that each eye could see only one screen By showing each eye a different image the system could create a D effect The way the system displayed images was not by LCD s as some would think At the time LCDs could not be used because they had two problems when they were first tested on the console they would blur if anything moved on the screen and users would see double instead of depth Instead a vertical line of very bright but very small LEDs were used for each eye These LEDs flashed on and off very fast in certain patterns This line of LEDs was then magnified by a lens and a vibrating mirror would reflect each line at a certain time into each eye creating a full image due to the human eye s persistence of vision Unfortunately due to the quick flashing of the LEDs many users felt sick became dizzy or had headaches after playing for a long time To help this an automatic pause feature was added which stopped the game play every minutes for the player to rest his or her eyes The Virtual Boy was first sold in but was not popular Consumer s did not like the console s high price monochrome graphics eye and neck strain and need for a stand Many were saving money for the soon to be sold Nintendo Nintendo lowered the price many times but the system did not sell well and was discontinued in Only games were released in Japan and North America Popular games for the system include Mario Tennis and Virtual Boy Wario Land The Virtual Boy was made by Gunpei Yokoi who also made the Game Boy and Game Watch
