 Horneophyton is a genus of Devonian early Devonian fossil land plant s Its fossils are very common in the Rhynie chert Both the sporophyte and a female gametophyte have been found as fossils The sporophyte was about cm tall and the gametophyte was about cm tall It is not really a vascular plant It had vascular tissue but the cell s had thin walls Horneophyton had plant anatomy anatomy similar to the hornwort s It is also similar to the vascular plant Rhynia which lived at the same time It might therefore be a missing link between the Bryophyte s like hornworts and the vascular plants like Rhynia
