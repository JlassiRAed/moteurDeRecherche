A Hamiltonian path is a path in a graph which contains each vertex of the graph exactly once A Hamiltonian cycle is a Hamiltonian path which is also a cyclle attached to the edges Hamiltonian paths and cycles and cycle paths are named after William Rowan Hamilton who invented the Icosian game This game is also known as Hamilton s puzzle It involves finding a Hamiltonian cycle in the edge graph of the dodecahedron Hamilton solved this problem using the Icosian Calculus an algebraic structure based on root of unity roots of unity with many similarities to the quaternion s This solution does not generalize to arbitrary graphs However despite being named after Hamilton Hamiltonian cycles in polyhedra had also been studied a year earlier by Thomas Kirkman citation
