The word rounding for a number numerical value means replacing it by another value that is approximately equal but has a shorter simpler or more explicit form For example US could be rounded to US or the Fraction fraction could be rounded to or the expression as Rounding is often done on purpose to obtain a value that is easier to write and handle than the original It may be done also to indicate the accuracy of a computed number for example a quantity that was computed as but is known to be accurate only to within a few hundred units is better stated as about On the other hand rounding can introduce some round off error in the result Rounding is almost unavoidable in many computation s especially when dividing two numbers in integer or fixed point arithmetic when computing mathematical functions such as square root s logarithm s and sine s or when using a floating point representation with a fixed number of significant digits In a sequence of calculations these rounding errors generally accumulate and in certain ill conditioned cases then they may make the result meaningless Accurate rounding of transcendental function transcendental mathematical functions is difficult because the number of extra digits that need to be calculated to resolve whether to round up or down cannot be known in advance This problem is known as The table maker s dilemma the table maker s dilemma Rounding has many similarities to the quantization quantization that occurs when physical quantity physical quantities must be encoded by numbers or digital signal s
