 Poisson s ratio is a measure of the contraction that happens when an object is stretched This contraction is perpendicular to the stretching force It can also expand as the object is compressed in a perpendicular direction For example if a block is being stretched as shown in the image to the right the equation for the poisson s ratio will be Poisson s ratio ranges from for common materials though for materials with certain structures can be as low as A material with a Poisson s ratio close to will cause it to become much more narrow A material with a negative Poisson s ratio will expand in all directions as it is stretched
