 Radio galaxies and their relatives radio loud quasar s and blazar s are types of active galactic nucleus active galaxy that are very luminous at radio waves radio wavelengths They have luminosities up to The radio emission is due to the synchrotron synchrotron process The observed structure in radio emission is determined by the interaction between twin relativistic jet jets and the external medium modified by the effects of relativistic beaming Radio galaxies are almost exclusively large elliptical galaxy elliptical galaxies Radio loud active galaxies can be detected at large distances making them valuable tools for observation Recently much work has been done on the effects of these objects on the intergalactic medium particularly in galaxy cluster galaxy groups and clusters
