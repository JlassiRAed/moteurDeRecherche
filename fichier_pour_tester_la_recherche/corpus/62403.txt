An alveolus is a word used in anatomy for hollow cavities which are empty areas within a body Although there are many different types of alveoli in the body the word alveoli is usually used to talk about small air sacs in the lung s of mammal s These are also called pulmonary alveoli These alveoli are located at the ends of the bronchiole air passageways in the lungs They have very thin wet walls and are surrounded with a network of small blood vessels or capillaries This allows gas es to diffusion diffuse or move across the surface of the alveolus When a mammal breathes in the concentration of oxygen is higher in the alveolus than in the red blood cells Therefore oxygen leaves the alveolus and enters the red blood cells When a mammal breathes out the opposite happens The concentration of carbon dioxide is lower in the alveolus than in the red blood cells so carbon dioxide leaves the red blood cells enters the alveolus and is exhalation exhaled In an average human lung there are million alveoli Inside the alveoli is where a gas exchange occurs Gas exchange is a biological process through which different gases are transferred in opposite directions across a specialised respiratory surface Gases are constantly required and produced as a by product of cellular and metabolic reactions so an efficient system for their exchange is extremely important It is linked with respiration in animals and both respiration and photosynthesis in plants
