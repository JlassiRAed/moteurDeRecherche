 Slime moulds or slime molds are forms of life which live on the rainforest floor and many other parts of the world They slither over ground and fallen tree trunks in search of food They scatter spore s like plant s which grow into new slime moulds They are a way of life or life form which has evolved a number of times Because they are not a monophyletic group they are put into several different phyla They have some features of fungi and some features of protozoa cite book They spend part of their lives as isolated cells but come together when a signal transduction chemical signal is released Then together they form a multicellular organism which reproduces and makes spore s So they are both single celled and multicellular That is not all the multicellular form loses its cell wall s and becomes a syncytium This is an organism with many nuclei but few or no cell walls The single cells are amoeboid The multi nuclear stage is called a plasmodium It is diploid formed from fusions between pairs of amoeboid cells It gains nutrition by Phagocytosis phagocytosing bacteria and food particles As the food supply fades the plasmodium makes haploid cells by meiosis and they form the basis of spores The spores are kept and then distributed from a structure like a sporangium This life cycle is typical of the main group called Mycetozoa
