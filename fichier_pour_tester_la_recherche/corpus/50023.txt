The Report of was a resolution drafted by James Madison It argued for the sovereignty of the individual U S State states under the United States Constitution and against the Alien and Sedition Acts The Virginia General Assembly adopted the Report in January The document primarily subtly amends arguments from the Virginia Resolutions The main reason for making the Report was to answer criticisms that had been leveled at the Resolutions The Report was the last important explication of the Constitution produced before the Bonus Bill Veto Message The arguments made in the Resolutions and the Report were later used frequently during the nullification crisis of when South Carolina declared federal tariff s to be unconstitutional and void within the state Madison however rejected the concept of nullification and the notion that his arguments supported such a practice Whether Madison s theory of republicanism really supported the nullification movement and more broadly whether the ideas he expressed between and are consistent with his work before and after this period are the main questions surrounding the Report in the modern literature
