 Maximum likelihood estimation is the name used for a number of ways to guess the parameters of a parametrised statistics statistical model These methods pick the value of the parameter in such a way that the probability distribution makes the observed values very likely The method was mainly devleoped by Ronald Aylmer Fisher R A Fisher in the early th century A likelihood estimation where prior porbabilities probabilities are known beforehand is known as Maximum a posteriori estimation
