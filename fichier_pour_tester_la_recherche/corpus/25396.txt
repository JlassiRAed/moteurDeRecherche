 Flightless birds are birds which cannot flight fly They rely on their ability to run or swim and have evolved from their flying ancestors the best known being the ostrich emu cassowary Rhea rhea kiwi and penguin Two key differences between flying and flightless birds are the smaller wing bones of flightless birds and the absent keel on their breastbone The keel anchors muscles needed for wing movement Flightless birds also have more feather feathers than flying birds New Zealand has more species of flightless birds than any other country One reason is that until the arrival of humans a thousand years ago there were no large land predators in New Zealand The main predators of flightless birds were larger birds Some flightless varieties of island birds are closely related to flying varieties This Implication implies that flight is a significant biological cost As soon as birds do not need to fly there is natural selection selection against flight The smallest flightless bird is the Inaccessible Island Rail although some extinct birds grew to larger sizes Flightless birds are easy to take care of in captivity because they do not have to be caged Ostriches were once farmed for their decorative feathers Today they are raised for meat and for their skins which are used to make leather There were also other families of flightless birds such as the now extinct Phorusrhacidae that evolved to be very powerful terrestrial predators
