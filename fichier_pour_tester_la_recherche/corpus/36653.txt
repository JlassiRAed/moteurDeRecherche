A thioketone is any molecule with the functional group group RC S It is like a ketone with the oxygen atom changed with a sulfur one The sulfur atom has a double bond with the carbon atom It also keeps two lone pair s Thioketones are very reactive This is because they are good electrophile s Many of them are unstable They want to form cyclic compound ring s They do that with cycloaddition reactions similar to the Diels Alder reaction If one of the R groups is hydrogen the molecule is the sulfur version of an aldehyde It is called a thial and it is even more reactive than a thioketone
