In mathematics a power series is an infinite series of the form where a represents the coefficient of the nth term c is a constant and x varies around c function the Taylor series article contains many examples In many situations c is equal to zero for instance when considering a Maclaurin series In such cases the power series takes the simpler form f sum n infty a n x n a a x a x a x cdots These power series arise primarily in analysis but also occur in combinatorics The familiar decimal notation for integer s can also be viewed as an example of a power series but with the argument x fixed at In number theory the concept of p adic number s is also closely related to that of a power series
