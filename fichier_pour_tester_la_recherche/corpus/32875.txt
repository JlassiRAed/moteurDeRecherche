 The following discussion is preserved as an archive of a Wikipedia Requests for permissions permissions request that did not succeed Closed as unsuccessful This request is a rather difficult one to close I see and understand both sides and was really uncertain about how to close this request However I m not much a fan of plain counting I consider the comments made here Also for me all votes made count as long as they are made before the closing There might be cases where crats intentionally keep requests open for longer I ve closed this as not successful as we re already below of support here Back the time when Only or even myself became admins here being three months around was enough However that was like ages ago While WP CFA has not been changed over that time the community has changed and may does no longer agree with it The criteria are only a guideline here In my point of view the consensus here to grant the mop is not strong enough I think after some more time you ve better chances to pass an RfA on this project User Barras December
