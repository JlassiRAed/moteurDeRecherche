 Stem cells are cells of the body which can mitosis divide and become cell differentiation differentiated When an organism grows stem cells specialize and take specific function s For instance mature Tissue tissues like skin muscle blood bone liver nerves all have different types of cells Because stem cells are not yet differentiated they can change to become some kind of wikt special specialized cells Organisms also use stem cells to replace damaged cells Stem cells are found in most if not all plant s and animal s They divide and differentiate into a range of cell types Research in the stem cell field grew out of findings in the s The two broad types of mammalian stem cells are embryonic stem cells and adult stem cells which are found in adult tissues In a developing embryo stem cells can differentiate into all of the specialised embryonic tissues In adult organisms stem cells act as a repair system for the body replenishing specialized cells but also maintain the normal turnover of blood skin and intestine intestinal tissues Stem cells can be grown in tissue culture In culture they can be transformed into specialised cells such as those of muscles or nerves Highly plastic adult stem cells can be taken from a variety of sources including umbilical cord blood and bone marrow They are now used in medical therapies and researchers expect that stem cells will be used in many future therapies
