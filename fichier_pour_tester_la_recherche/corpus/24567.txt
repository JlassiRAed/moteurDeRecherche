 Xanthophylls are types of yellow pigment s that can be seen in natural objects They are found in the leaves of most green plants They are difficult to see in a healthy leaf because chlorophyll pigments make the leaf green Unlike chlorophyll however xanthophylls do not need light for production Therefore leaves will only show the yellow pigments if the leaf does not get enough light The name comes from the Greek words for yellow xanthos
