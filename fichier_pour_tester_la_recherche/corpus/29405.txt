 Nucleotides are chemical compound s the building blocks of the nucleic acid s RNA and DNA A nucleotide is composed of a nucleobase and one phosphate group Nucleotides contain either a purine or a pyrimidine base Ribonucleotides are nucleotides in which the sugar is ribose Deoxyribonucleotides are nucleotides in which the sugar is deoxyribose In DNA the purine bases are adenine and guanine while the pyrimidines are thymine and cytosine RNA uses uracil in place of thymine Adenine always pairs with thymine by hydrogen bonds while guanine pairs with cytosine through hydrogen bonds each due to their unique structures
