The respiratory system also called the gas exchange system is the body getting rid of carbon dioxide and taking in oxygen Carbon dioxide a waste product goes out of the body Oxygen which the body needs comes in The first step in this process is breathing in air or inhalation inhaling The taking in of air rich in oxygen into the body is called inhalation and giving out of air rich in carbon dioxide from the body is called exhalation The second step is gas exchange in the lungs where oxygen is diffusion diffused into the blood and the carbon dioxide diffuses out of the blood The third process is cellular respiration which produces the chemical energy that the cells in the body need and carbon dioxide Finally the carbon dioxide from cellular respiration is breathed out of body from the lungs
