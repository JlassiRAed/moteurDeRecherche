In mathematics a linear equation is a type of equation In a linear equation both term s have to be constant term constant A linear equation is the equation of a straight line This type of equation is written in the form y mx b or where m the rate of change or slope The slope is how fast the line moves up or down Larger numbers will make the slope steeper If m is a negative number then the line will appear to fall or go down the page when read from left to right If m is a positive number then the line will appear to climb the page when read from left to right b the y intercept of the function This is where the function crosses the y axis of the coordinate plane The first equation is called slope intercept form because in it the slope are easily found math stub
