A punt is a flat boat with a broad bow front designed for use in small river s or other shallow water Punting means boating in a punt The punter pushes a pole against the river bed and this gives the punt a way to move Punts were originally built as cargo boats or platforms for shooting at birds and fishing but in modern times they are mostly used for pleasure trips on the rivers in the university towns of Oxford and Cambridge in England and are raced at summer regattas on the Thames
