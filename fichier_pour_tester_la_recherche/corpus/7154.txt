 Ohm s law says that in an electrical circuit the Electric current current passing through a resistor between two points is related to the voltage difference between the two points and inversely related to the electrical resistance between the two points This relation is shown in the following formula Where I is the current in ampere s V is the potential difference in volt s and R is a constant measured in ohm s called the electrical resistance resistance Current is directly proportional to voltage loss through a resistor That is if the current doubles then so does the voltage To make a current flow through a resistance there must be a voltage across that resistance Ohm s Law shows the relationship between the voltage It can be written in three ways
