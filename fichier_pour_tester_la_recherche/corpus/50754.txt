The ozone layer is a layer of ozone high up in the Earth s atmosphere stratosphere In the region between about kilometres and about kilometres above ground the atmosphere contains more ozone The exact amount of ozone that can be found varies the season s influence it it is also different in different places on the Earth This radiation is dangerous to many living organism s on Earth Over the last hundred years the ozone layer has been wikt damage damaged by man made chemicals especially ones called CFCs CFCs were used for various purposes They have been replaced by other substances for most applications These CFCs are broken down in the upper atmosphere where they react with the ozone This causes ozone depletion The ozone layer was discovered in by the French people French physicists Charles Fabry and Henri Buisson Its properties were explored in detail by the British meteorologist G M B Dobson who developed a simple Spectrophotometry spectrophotometer the Dobson spectrometer Dobsonmeter This tool could be used to measure the ozone levels found in the stratosphere from the ground Between and Dobson established a worldwide network of ozone monitoring stations Most of these stations are still in use today The Dobson unit a convenient measure of the total amount of ozone in a column overhead is named in his honor
