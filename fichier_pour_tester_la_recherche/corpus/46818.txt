 Polyphyly is a term in cladistics The diagrams show that birds and mammals are indeed related but only at the level of the early amniote s In terms of evolution there is a vast gulf between them More common in traditional taxonomy is to include all descendants This is done for convenience but it makes the mammals polyphyletic Biological classification aims to group species together such that every group is descended from a single common ancestor A polyphyletic group can be fixed either by excluding clade s or by adding the common ancestor According to cladistics it should be the aim of classification to ensure that all groups are monophyletic However other taxonomists argue that there is a valid place for groups that are paraphyletic contain their most recent common ancestor but does not all the descendants of that ancestor
