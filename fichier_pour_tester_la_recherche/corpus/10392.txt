In mathematics hyperbolic geometry is a non Euclidean geometry meaning that the parallel postulate of Euclidean geometry is replaced The parallel postulate in Euclidean geometry says that in two dimensional space for any given line l and point P not on l there is exactly one line through P that does not intersect l This line is called parallel to l In hyperbolic geometry there are at least two such lines through P As they do not intersect l the parallel postulate is false Models have been constructed within Euclidean geometry that obey the axioms of hyperbolic geometry These models prove that the parallel postulate is independent of the other postulates of Euclid Because there is no hyperbolic analogue to Euclidean parallel lines the hyperbolic use of parallel and related terms varies among writers In this article the two limiting lines are called asymptotic and lines that have a common perpendicular are called ultraparallel the simple word parallel may apply to both
