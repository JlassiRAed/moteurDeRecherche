 Chemical biology is a science that combines the fields of chemistry and biology It involves the application of chemical techniques and tools often compounds produced through chemical synthesis synthetic chemistry to the study and wikt manipulation manipulation of biological systems This is a wikt slightly slightly different from biochemistry Biochemistry is the study of the chemistry of biological molecule s For example a biochemist studies the three dimensional structure of a protein and how that structure relates to the chemistry of the protein Also biochemistry studies the way enzymes work Chemical biologists use chemical principles to modulate systems They do this to either wikt investigate investigate biology relationships or create new function s In this way the research done by chemical biologists is often closer to that of cell biology than biochemistry In short biochemists deal with the chemistry of biology chemical biologists deal with chemistry applied to biology
