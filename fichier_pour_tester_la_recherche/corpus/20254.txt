 Conserved sequences are similar or identical DNA sequencing sequences which occur in DNA and cause sequences in RNA proteins and carbohydrates These sequences occur across species This shows that the sequences has been maintained in evolution despite speciation The further back up the phylogenetic tree a particular conserved sequence occurs the more highly conserved it is Since sequence information is normally transmitted from parents to progeny by gene s a conserved sequence implies that there is a conserved gene Conservation of a sequence happens when mutations in a highly conserved region lead to non viable life forms that is a form which is eliminated through natural selection In other words the product of the gene is vital to life and its function is destroyed by almost all changes to the sequence
