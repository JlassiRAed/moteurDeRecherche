 DNA repair means the processes by which a cell identifies and corrects damage to its DNA molecule s In cells normal metabolism metabolic activities and environmental factors such as UV light and radiation damage DNA There are as many as a million molecular lesions per cell per day Many of these lesions cause structural damage to the DNA molecule and can alter or eliminate the cell s ability to transcription transcribe the affected gene Other lesions induce potentially harmful mutation s in the cell s genome which affect the survival of its daughter cells after it mitosis divides The DNA repair process must be constantly active so it can respond rapidly to any damage in the DNA structure The rate of DNA repair depends on many factors including the cell type the age of the cell and the extracellular environment A cell that has accumulated a lot of DNA damage or one that no longer effectively repairs damage can enter one of three states an irreversible state of dormancy known as senescence cell suicide also known as apoptosis unregulated cell division which can lead to the formation of a tumor that is cancer ous
