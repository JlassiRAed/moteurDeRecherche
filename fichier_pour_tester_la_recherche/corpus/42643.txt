The shape of the Universe cannot be discussed with everyday terms because all the terms need to be those of Einstein ian relativity The geometry of the universe is therefore not the ordinary Euclidean geometry of our everyday lives According to the special theory of relativity it is impossible to say whether two distinct events occur at the same time if those events are separated in space To speak of the shape of the universe is naive from the point of view of special relativity Due to the relativity of wikt simultaneity simultaneity we cannot speak of different points in space as being at the same point in time nor therefore of the shape of the universe at a point in time What Astrophysics astrophysicists do is ask whether a particular model of the universe is consistent with what is known through observations and measurements of the universe If the observable universe is smaller than the entire universe observation is limited to a part of the whole Consideration of the shape of the universe can be split into two local geometry which relates especially to the curve curvature of the universe especially in the observable universe and global geometry which relates to the topology of the universe as a whole measurement of which may not be possible The observable universe is the basis for testing any model of the universe It is a spherical volume centered on the observer regardless of the shape of the universe as a whole Every location in the universe has its own observable universe which may or may not overlap with the one centered on Earth Recent measurements have led NASA to state We now know that the universe is flat with only a margin of error cite journal
