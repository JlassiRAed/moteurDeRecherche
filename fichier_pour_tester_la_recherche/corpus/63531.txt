 Non seed bearing plants Horsetail Equisetophyta Lycopodiophyta Psilotophyta fern Pteridophyta Superdivision Spermatophyta Pinophyta Cycad Cycadophyta Ginkgo Ginkgophyta Gnetophyta Flowering plant Magnoliophyta The vascular plants tracheophytes or higher plants are plant s that have specialized Tissue tissue s for conducting water mineral s and Photosynthesis photosynthetic products through the plant They include the fern s clubmoss es horsetail s flowering plant s conifer s and other gymnosperm s The vascular plants are set apart in two main ways Vascular plants have vascular tissues which circulate resources through the plant This feature allows vascular plants to grow to a larger size than non vascular plants which lack these specialized conducting tissues and are therefore restricted to relatively small sizes In vascular plants the principal generation phase is the sporophyte which is diploid with two sets of chromosomes per cell Water transport happens in either xylem or phloem xylem carries water and inorganic solute s upward toward the leaves from the roots while phloem carries Organic chemistry organic solutes throughout the plant
