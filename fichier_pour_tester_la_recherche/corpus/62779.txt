The amplitude or peak amplitude of a wave is a measure of how big its oscillation is Amplitudes are always measured as positive numbers That s because distance can only be greater than zero or equal to zero negative distance does not exist The distance from the top of one peak to the bottom of another is called peak to peak amplitude Another way to describe peak to peak amplitude is to say that it is the distance between the maximum positive value and the maximum negative value of a wave
