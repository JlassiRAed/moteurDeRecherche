For Jewish people YHVH is the most holy name of God as written in the ancient Hebrew language The written language showed no vowel s so the pronunciation is not agreed on However most academics agree that Yahweh is the most accepted way to say it It has also been pronounced as Yehova in Hebrew as a substitute word for the tetragramaton This is because Hebrew pointing or vowel symbols are often put under the YHVH making The vowels used come from the Hebrew word for Lord Adonai which after the last captivity was substituted and the vowels of Adonai forced into the tetragrammaton incorrectly spelling God s Hebrew name as YaHoVaH It was never meant to be anything more than a substitute to avoid pronouncing the tetragrammaton Traditionally religious Jews today do not often say this name aloud This is because it is believed to be too holy to be spoken However they often use substitutes when referring to the name of their God For example they use HaShem Today the three Abraham ic religions say that there is only one God defined in the Judeo ChristianScriptures as Yahweh almost times with the general name Elohim a distant second at times Yahweh was spoken often by Jews Inthe New Testament Yahweh is also present with the expanded name of Yeshua Sometimes the four letters are called the Tetragrammaton which is Greek for four letters These four letters are usually JHWH in German French and Dutch and either YHWH YHVH JHWH or JHVH in English In some English language Bibles it is written in all capital letters as LORD as in Jewish tradition Others such as the Jerusalem Bible use Yahweh The Holman Christian Study Bible uses Yahweh when there is a reference to his name God s Word Translation uses all of the Hebrew transliterations for the name of God The name Jehovah is used by the religious organisation of Jehovah s Witnesses based on early English Bible translations repeated by the KJV In the Vatican reiterated a directive that the full name YAHWEH should not be used in Catholic liturgy out of respect for the Jews who never pronounce the full word and YHWH was to be used instead
