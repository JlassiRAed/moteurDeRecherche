In orbital mechanics a Hohmann transfer orbit moves a spacecraft between orbiting heights It is the most fuel efficient method to do so because the spacecraft is not trying to escape the planet s gravity using an Orbital eccentricity elliptical orbit for the transfer A ship using this would have to apply two Velocity velocities one to enter the elliptical orbit and one to enter the second orbit
