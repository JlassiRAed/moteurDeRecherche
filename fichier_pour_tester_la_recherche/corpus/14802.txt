 Gabbro is a large group of dark coarse grained igneous rock s They are chemically equivalent to basalt The rocks are Intrusive plutonic formed when molten magma is trapped under the Earth s surface and cools into a crystal line mass Most of the Earth s surface has gabbro in the oceanic crust produced by basalt magma tism at mid ocean ridge s In general when the gabbro is formed it lies above the Earth s mantle and below the basalt Gabbro is generally coarse grained with crystals in the size range of mm or greater It is an essential part of the oceanic crust Long belts of gabbro intrusions are typically formed at proto Rift rift zone s and around ancient rift zone margins
