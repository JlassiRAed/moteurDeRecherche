 Reactivity is a Measurement measure of how much a Chemical substance substance tends to chemical reaction react with other things Some substances are more reactive and others are less reactive Reactivity is set by several factors Reactivity involves both the thermodynamics and chemical kinetics kinetics of the particular chemical reaction A reaction will be more reactive if the total energy of the products is less than the total energy of the reactant s A reaction will be more reactive if the energy of its transition is low Lithium reacts with water and air Gold does not react with water or air Gold is unreactive thus low on the reactivity series Lithium is reactive There are several ways to measure reactivity Some are reducing agent s and others can be oxidizing agent s Some absorb water easily Some break down easily
