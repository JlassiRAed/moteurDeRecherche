 RFA Hi everyone This article is about the WP RFA RFA process here at Simple As you might have noticed there have been are some quite controversial Requests for adminship going on There have been some really ridiculous opposing votes against some candidates like not being active enough they didn t like someone s personnal life or even not having enough qd tags and VIP reports But that s not the worst thing The worst thing is that they did not oppose the other candidate even though he did not have as many QD tags and was not as active I think it s come to the point were the system needs new rules It doesn t seem a fair system anymore and I invite you to comment at WT RFA RFA talk Thank you January UTC
