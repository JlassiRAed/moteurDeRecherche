 Reed Solomon error correction is an error correcting code It works by oversampling a polynomial constructed from the Information data The polynomial is evaluated at several points and these values are sent or recorded Sampling the polynomial more often than is necessary makes the polynomial over determined As long as it receives many of the points correctly the receiver can recover the original polynomial even in the presence of a few bad points Reed Solomon codes are used in many different kinds of commercial applications for example in Compact disc CDs DVD s and Blu ray Disc s in data transmission technologies such as DSL WiMAX and broadcast systems such as Digital Video Broadcasting DVB and ATSC Standards ATSC
