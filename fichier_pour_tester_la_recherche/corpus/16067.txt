The Fourier transform is a mathematical Function function that can be used to show the different parts of a continuous signal It is most used to convert from time domain to frequency domain Fourier transforms are often used to calculate the frequency spectrum of a signal that changes over time This kind of signal processing has many uses such as cryptography oceanography speech recognition or handwriting recognition Fourier transforms can also be used to solve differential equation s The Fourier transform of a function is given byThe inverse Fourier transform is given byA Fourier transform shows what frequencies are in a signal For example consider a sound wave which contains three different musical note s A B and C Making a graph of the Fourier transform of this sound wave will show a peak at each frequency which corresponds with one of the musical notes Many signals can be created by adding together cosines and sines with varying amplitude s and frequencies The Fourier transform plots the amplitudes and phase s of these cosines and sines against their respective frequencies Fourier transforms are important because many signals make more sense when their frequencies are separated In the audio example above looking at the signal with respect to time does not make it obvious that the notes A B and C are in the signal Many systems do different things to different frequencies so these kinds of systems can be described by what they do to each frequency An example of this is a filter which blocks high frequencies Calculating a Fourier transform requires understanding of Integral integration and imaginary number s Computers are usually used to calculate Fourier transforms of anything but the simplest signals The Fast Fourier Transform is a method computers use to quickly calculate a Fourier transform File Function ocsillating at hertz svg Original function showing a signal oscillating at hertz File Onfreq svgFile Offfreq svgFile Fourier transform of oscillating function svg
