 Menoitios as punishment for his hybristic behaviour He was a son of Iapetus and Clymene or Asia and a brother of Atlas Prometheus and Epimetheus He was killed by Zeus with a flash of lightning in the fight of the Titans and thrown into Tartarus The name Menoitios was derives from the Greek words menos meaning variously might force spirit passion batterage and oitos meaning ill fated or doomed Hesiod also describes him as hybristes a violent overbearing and insolent man Menoitios and his brothers the sons of Iapetos were all depicted with extreme human foibles Prometheus was overly crafty Epimetheus a fool and Atlas exceedingly daring Menoitios was perhaps identical to Menoites the herdsman of Hades whom Herakles wrestled with in the underworld This connection with cattle suggests that he was also the same as Bouphagos son of Iapetos a hybristic man who attacked the goddess Artemis in Arkadia
