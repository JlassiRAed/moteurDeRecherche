 Gastrulation is a phase early in the development of most animal embryo s In it the embryo is dramatically restructured by cell migration Gastrulation varies in different phylum phyla It is followed by organogenesis when individual organs develop within the newly formed germ layers The gastrula is the double walled stage of the embryo During gastrulation some of the cells of the blastula migrate inwards to make an inner layer the endoderm In some animals another cell layer forms the mesoderm between the endoderm and the ectoderm
