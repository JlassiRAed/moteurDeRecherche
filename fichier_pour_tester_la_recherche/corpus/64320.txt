In physics moment of force is a measure of its tendency to cause a body to rotate about a specific point or axis In this concept the moment arm the distance from the axis of rotation plays an important role The lever pulley gear and most other simple machines create mechanical advantage by changing the moment arm The SI unit for moment is the newton meter Formula for moment Moment Force multiply by perpendicular distanceThe Principle of Moment states that when a system is in equilibrium the sum of its CLOCKWISE MOMENTS equals the sum of its ANTICLOCKWISE MOMENTS Some examples where moments are applied are in the use of levers These examples are Seesaw opening and closing of doors nutcracker can opener crowbar etc A lever is a simple machine in which one force called the effort is used to overcome another force called the load In physics moment is a combination of a physical quantity and a distance
