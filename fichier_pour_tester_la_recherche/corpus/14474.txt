 Image Alessandro Volta jpg thumb Alessandro Giuseppe Antonio Anastasio Volta Count Alessandro Giuseppe Antonio Anastasio Volta was a Lombardy Lombard physicist known especially for the development of the first electrical cell in He was born in Como in Lombardy Italy Volta worked on the electrophorus that makes a static electric charge in Volta also studied what we now call capacitance developing separate means to study both electrical potential V and charge Q and discovering that for a given object they are proportional This may be called Volta s Law of Capacitance and likely for this work the unit of electrical potential has been named the volt Around he began to study animal electricity In this way he discovered Volta s Law of the electrochemical series and the law that the electromotive force of a galvanic cell In he invented the voltaic pile an early battery electric battery which made a steady electric current It is credited as the first electrochemical cell In honor of his work in the field of electricity Napoleon made him a count in A museum in Como the Voltian Temple has been built in his honor and exhibits some of the original equipment he used to conduct experiments In an important electrical unit the volt was named in his honor There have also been innovations and discoveries named after Alessandro Volta including the Chevy Volt and the Volta Crater on the Moon Volta married the daughter of Count Ludovico Peregrini Teresa They raised three sons In he became professor of experimental physics at the University of Pavia He had the job for almost years Volta is buried in the city of Como At the Tempio Voltiano near Lake Como there is a museum about him and his work
