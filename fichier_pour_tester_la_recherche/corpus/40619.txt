In Euclidean geometry Euclidean space a wikt region region is a convex set if the following is true For any two points inside the region a straight line wikt segment segment can be drawn If every point on that segment is inside the region then the region is convex The point is that a convex curve forms the boundary of a convex set So any shape which is concave or has a hollow cannot be a convex set
