In mathematics algebraic varieties are one of the central objects of study in algebraic geometry The first definitons of algebraic variety defined it as the set of solutions of a system of polynomial equations over the real number real or complex number s Modern definitions of an algebraic variety generalize this notion while they try to preserve the geometric intuition behind the original definition cite book Conventions regarding the definition of an algebraic variety differ Some authors require that an algebraic variety is by definition irreducible while others do not When the former convention is used non irreducible algebraic varieties are called algebraic sets The notion of variety is similar to that of manifold One difference between a variety and a manifold is that a variety may have singular point of an algebraic variety singular points while a manifold will not Proven around the year the fundamental theorem of algebra establishes a link between algebra and geometry by showing that a monic polynomial in one variable with complex numbers complex coefficients ideals of polynomial ring s and algebraic sets Using the Nullstellensatz and related results mathematicians have established a strong correspondence between questions on algebraic sets and questions of ring theory This correspondence is the specifity of algebraic geometry among the other subareas of geometry
