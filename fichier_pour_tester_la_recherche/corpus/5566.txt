A hierarchy is a way of ranking and organizing wikt thing things or wikt people people Beneath the top of the hierarchy each part of it is below some other part This turns out to be like a pyramid It is a system to decide who can make decisions and who is forced to comply with those decisions An example with people would be the structure of a company There is the top manager and there are a few levels of middle and lower management At the bottom are the common worker s Another example would be an army that might have a General officer general followed by colonel s corporal s and sergeant s then Private privates In democracy this is done by educating people in the Issue issues and then vote voting in an election to choose leader s or a referendum to actually choose one option from several Competing power network s each form a political party and each offers only one leader or one option to the public to simplify the issues to make decisions possible After the decision they typically do not fight it to the point of civil war but wait for the next election In dictator ship this is done by asking one powerful person to make the decision and then agreeing to force everyone to follow it Any who will not are exile d im prison ed or kill ed even if the decision is not very important since the refusal to follow is taken as a challenge to the power structure itself There is only one power network and all others are forced to become part of it or fight it Civil war is much more common in a dictatorship than in a democracy In these examples people who are higher up have more authority and Influence power than people below them
