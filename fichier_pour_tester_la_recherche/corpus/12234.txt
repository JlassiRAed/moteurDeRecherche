 A lightning arrester is a device that is used to switch a lightning strike from something such as a television antenna to a metal rod about two meters long that is buried in the ground If a lightning arrester is not used then the lightning will go through the television set and burn it out A lightning arrester does not really arrest or stop lightning It diverts or changes the way lightning goes so that it ends up going into the ground instead of going into a television set or other device that it could hurt
