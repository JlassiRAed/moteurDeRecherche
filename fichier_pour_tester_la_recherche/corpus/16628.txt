A nucleophile is a chemical species species that donates an electron pair to an electrophile to form a chemical bond in a Chemical reaction reaction All molecule s or ion s with a free pair of electron s can be nucleophiles This pair of electrons is called lone pair Because nucleophiles donate electrons they fit the definition of Lewis base s Nucleophilic describes the attraction of a nucleophile to the nuclei Nucleophilicity sometimes referred to as nucleophile strength refers to a substance s nucleophilic character and is often used to compare the attraction of atoms Neutral nucleophilic reactions with solvents such as alcohol s and water are called solvolysis Nucleophiles may take part in nucleophilic substitution reactions In those reactions a nucleophile becomes attracted to a full or partial positive charge
