In geometry an antiprism is a polyhedron It is made of two copies of a regular polygon These polygons are connected using an alternating band of triangle s To connect an n sided polygon n triangles are needed Antiprisms are similar to Prism prisms but prisms use parallelogram s for the bands at the side A right antiprism uses a right angle to connect the base polygons to the band of triangles A uniform antiprism uses equilateral triangle equilateral triangles as base surfaces math stub
