The second law of thermodynamics says that when energy changes from one form to another form or matter moves freely entropy increases Differences in temperature pressure and density tend to even out horizontally after a while Due to the force of gravity density and pressure do not even out vertically Density and pressure on the bottom will be more than at the top Entropy is a measure of spread of matter and energy to everywhere they have access The most common wording for the second law of thermodynamics is essentially due to Rudolf Clausius In other words everything tries to maintain the same temperature over time There are many statements of the second law which use different terms but are all equal Another statement by Clausius is An equivalent statement by Lord Kelvin is The second law only applies to large systems The second law is is about the likely behavior of a system where no energy or matter gets in or out The bigger the system is the more likely the second law will be true
