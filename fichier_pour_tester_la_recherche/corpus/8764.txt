In introductory chemistry the reactivity series or activity series is an empiricism empirical series of metal s in order of reactivity from highest to lowest It is used to summarize information about the chemical reaction s of metals with acids and water single displacement reactions and the extraction of metals from their ores The elements at a higher level are more reactive whereas the elements at a lower level are less reactive Reactivity series of common metals Potassium K Sodium Na Calcium Ca Magnesium Mg AlZnFeNiSnPbCuHgAgAuPt
