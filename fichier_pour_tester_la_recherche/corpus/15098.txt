 List of animal phyla is a list of the major groups of animal s usually classified as a phylum Modern sources have been used the list is different from that of Linnaeus or Cuvier A list of this type may be arranged alphabetically but equally it might be arranged according to evolutionary relationships No list will be completely satisfactory Authorities differ in what they consider a phylum and in the actual name of the phylum Despite this there is agreement on most phyla Most modern surveys include groups above the phylum superphyletic groupings based on evidence of common descent Differences of opinion about evolutionary relationships have been reduced by the use of molecular evolution and molecular clock research These make use of protein amino acid sequences and whole genome DNA sequence analysis These modern techniques have led to changes and renaming of many higher categories Classification based on traditional comparative anatomy had errors which needed to be corrected So for example the old phylum Coelenterata which had stood for almost two hundred years was split down into two separate phyla the Cnidaria and the Ctenophora The following list is based on evolutionary relationships
