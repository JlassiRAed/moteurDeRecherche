 Antibodies are large Y shaped proteins They are found in the blood or other body fluids of vertebrate s Antibodies are the key element in the adaptive immune system The antibody recognizes a unique part of the foreign target called an antigen Each tip of the Y of an antibody contains a structure that fits one particular key like structure on an antigen This binds the two structures together Using this binding mechanism an antibody can tag a microbe or an infected cell for attack by other parts of the immune system or can neutralize its target directly Each antibody is different They are all designed to attack only one kind of antigen For instance an antibody designed to destroy smallpox is unable to hit the bubonic plague or the common cold Though the general structure of all antibodies is very similar that small region at the tip of the protein is extremely variable This allows millions of antibodies with different tip structures to exist Each of these variants can bind to a different antigen
