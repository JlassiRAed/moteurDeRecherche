Outputs the first parameter followed by a comma if both the second and third parameters are present or and if only the second parameter is present This is useful in constructing lists so that each item can be output with the appropriate separator ready for the next item in the list Optionally arbitrary text can be output if neither second nor third parameters are specified that is if the item is the last in the list This is useful for adding terminal punctuation such as a full stop without the need to do decide at a higher level template whether the item is the last This is an implementation template intended to be used by other templates in an article it is easier simply to write out the list longhand but in a template this can be complicated if the number of items in the list is unknown An alternative way of constructing such a list is to output the separator before each next item in the list but that still requires knowledge of whether another item is to follow to decide between the comma and and so the two implementations boil down to the same thing
