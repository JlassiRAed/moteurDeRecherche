 Exchange of gases or gas exchange is carried out by organisms where different gases move in different directions Animals microorganisms and plants breathe out carbon dioxide and breathe in oxygen To balance the air composition of air plants use carbon dioxide to carry out photosynthesis so oxygen is made Plants only carry this out during the day when there is sunlight Plants respiration respire all day and night In humans gas exchange happens in the alveolus These are in the lungs Oxygen diffusion diffuses into the bloodstream from the air Oxygen is used in aerobic respiration Carbon dioxide diffuses out of the bloodstream into the air Carbon dioxide is a waste product made by respiration
