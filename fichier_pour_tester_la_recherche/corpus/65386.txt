The Rule against Perpetuities is one of the most complicated rules in property law and wills and trusts In general the rule states that a gift of a will at the time the gift was created For example if a woman says in her will that her house is to be given to the children of her children when they graduate from college this would be not be enforced by a court It would not be enforced because one of her children s children might not graduate from college until years after everyone who was alive at the time of the woman s death has died The purpose of the rule is to prevent property from being tied up for perpetuity do not want to hold property to see who will receive it after a complicated set of rules from the gift giver First this would result in a waste of the courts time and resources Second it would be a waste of the property that is being given through the gift If a gift in a will violates the Rule against Perpetuities the court will simply strike that gift and transfer the subject of the gift as if the will had not mentioned it However many countries and states have changed this rule and it does not apply at all or in a changed way in those countries and states
