 Conduction in physics is about forms of energy such as light heat or electricity Heat conduction takes place between two objects in contact with each other Heat energy moves from one material to the other In heat conduction the heat energy travels from the hot point to a cold point Eventually the two materials will even out in temperature as the heat keeps on transferring until the temperatures are the same This is equilibrium For example a pan of hot soup is taken off the oven and put on a Table table The area of the table under the pot gets hot Heat from the pot moved to the table top by conduction Electrical conduction is usually done through wires or cables Something that electrons can easily move through is a good conductor Metal s are mostly good conductors An Insulator insulator like rubber is a poor conductor Plastic s are insulators Some materials such as glass are conductors for heat but not electricity Light is another type of energy It can be transmitted through light cables by fibre optics Fibre optic communication is of the greatest importance to telecommunication and computer networking Besides conduction the other major ways of moving energy are by radiation and convection
