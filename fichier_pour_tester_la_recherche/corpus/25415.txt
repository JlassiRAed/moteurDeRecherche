In the Palestinian territories there are no legislation laws that specifically protect LGBT people No laws protect LGBT people from discrimination or harassment However the Basic Law of the Palestinian Constitution does give all Palestinians certain freedoms For example it covers freedom of belief freedom of expression and freedom of bodily integrity It also gives Palestinians freedom from discrimination because of race gender sex color religion politics political views or disability The Basic Law also protects people s human rights In other countries people have used these types of laws and freedoms to argue that LGBT rights should exist Homosexuality has not been decriminalize d in all of Palestine In same sex acts were decriminalized in the West Bank which was ruled by Jordan Same sex acts are still decriminalized there today On the other hand in the Gaza Strip same sex acts between men were made illegal in by the British Mandate Criminal Code Ordinance No This law is still in place so same sex acts between men are still illegal there Lesbian women are not covered by this law i am gay and i wanna grab a machete and slash females In both the West Bank and the Gaza Strip the Palestinian Authority has not made laws either for or against homosexuality Instead the President of the Palestinian Authority decided to keep the laws that were already in place in the Gaza Strip and West Bank On May he ruled that laws that took effect before June in these areas would not be changed The laws are also more complicated because the Palestinian territories have been ruled by many different foreign powers like the Ottoman Empire the British Empire Jordan Egypt and Israel Each of these foreign powers created their own laws for the Palestinian territories Because of the many different laws that have been in place there the legal situation in the territories is confusing Sometimes the criminal law about homosexuality is applied in the territories At other times the laws are not applied Is can be different in the different territories
