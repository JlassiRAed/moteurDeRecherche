In cryptography Twofish is a Symmetric key algorithm symmetric key block cipher with a block size block size of bit s and Key size key lengths up to bits In the National Institute of Standards and Technology NIST announced for competition to choose a successor to Data Encryption Standard DES to be known as Advanced Encryption Standard AES Twofish was one of the five finalists of the Advanced Encryption Standard competition but was not selected as a standard Twofish is related to the earlier block cipher Blowfish from the SAFER family of ciphers Twofish uses the same Feistel network Feistel structure as the Data Encryption Standard DES On most software platforms Twofish is slightly slower than Rijndael key schedule Rijndael keys but somewhat faster for bit keys cite paper Twofish was design ed by Bruce Schneier John Kelsey Chris Hall and Niels Ferguson the extended Twofish team who met to made further cryptanalysis of Twofish and other AES Competition competitors included Stefan Lucks Tadayoshi Kohno and Mike Stay Twofish algorithm is Free software free for anyone to use without any restrictions whatsoever The Twofish cipher has not been patent ed and the software example of its specification has been placed in the public domain However Twofish is not widely used like the Blowfish Blowfish which has been available for a longer period of time
