 Physical chemistry uses physics to study chemical systems It studies them at macroscopic atomic subatomic and particle particulate levels It looks at concepts like motion energy Force force time thermodynamics quantum chemistry statistical mechanics and Analytical dynamics dynamics Physical chemistry is not the same as chemical physics Physical chemistry is mostly a macroscopic or supra molecular science The majority of physical chemistry concepts relate to bulk properties rather than to molecular atomic structure alone These include chemical equilibrium and colloids Some of the relationships that physical chemistry tries to resolve include the effects of Intermolecular forces on the physical properties of materials Chemical kinetics Reaction kinetics on the Reaction rate rate of a reaction The identity of ions on the electrical conductivity of materials Surface chemistry and electrochemistry of cell membrane membranes
