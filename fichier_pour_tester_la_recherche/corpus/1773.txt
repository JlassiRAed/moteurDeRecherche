 Longboarding is a form of skateboard ing Instead of using a normal sized board the longboarder uses a board that is generally longer than a skateboard hence the name longboards can range from all the way up to boards Unlike a bicycle a longboard is less vulnerable to theft as one s board may be carried under one s arm or stashed in a coat closet at work Advanced longboarders may be seen sliding of a longboard turn far more freely than that of a freestyle board One good way to learn how to ride a longboard is to find a roomy smooth flat area a plaza or parking lot say and to just cruise around Once the longboarder is feeling good and loose warmed up then he should take that rear foot been pushing with and try coasting without placing it back on the rear of the deck Just coast and notice how he actually can steer the board with one foot Notice too that one can go much faster if one keeps his body s weight balanced above the foot that remains on the board By pumping with the arms and pushing only with the ball of the driving foot one go much faster If one finds himself slamming his driving foot down on the pavement he will probably be in need of a rest Now he is ready to carve Carving is an action in which the rider leans back and forth slowing them down most longboarders go down mountains and hills unlike skateboarding longboarding aren t to good for tricks all though one can still do them
