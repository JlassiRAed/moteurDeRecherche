 Ferromagnetism is a property of many materials like iron They are magnets so they are attracted to or pulled towards other magnets In physics there are many different type of magnetism Ferromagnetism is the strongest one It is used every day in many technological objects like television screens and credit card s Ferromagnets are materials that have some magnetization on their own This means that at a temperature of absolute zero and without any magnetic field from other objects they are still magnetic The reason for this is that the electron s in a material have a spin spin In ferromagnetic materials the electrons like to have all the spins going one way giving some magnetism Usually as the temperature is increased the magnetization goes down This is because the temperature causes the electrons in the material to move around a bit more They do not have the spins perfectly going in the same way anymore The point at which there is no magnetization anymore is called the Curie temperature This changes with different materials Some materials that are ferromagnets are iron cobalt nickel Hematite is also ferromagnetic but only above a certain temperature
