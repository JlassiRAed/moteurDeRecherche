 Logic programming is using mathematical logic to write computer program s There are specialized programming language s where the user can directly enter logical statements Probably the best known of these languages is called Prolog Alonzo Church used a form of logic programming in what is known as lambda calculus today Logic programming has also been used in LISP Programs consist of a set of rules and facts In most cases logic programming uses what is called negation as failure or weak negation This means that if it is not possible to derive some clause from the facts and rules the system will assume that its negation is true
