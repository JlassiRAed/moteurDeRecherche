 Histones are protein s found in eukaryote eukaryotic cell nuclei which package the DNA into structural units called nucleosome s They are the chief protein components of chromatin the active component of chromosome s Histones act as spools around which DNA winds and play a role in gene regulation Without histones the unwound DNA in chromosomes would be very long For example each human cell has about meters of DNA but wound on the histones it has about millimeters of chromatin which when duplicated and condensed during mitosis result in about micrometers of chromosomes
