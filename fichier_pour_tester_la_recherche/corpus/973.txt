 Homotopies are studied in a branch of mathematics known as Algebraic Topology A homotopy is a wikt deformation deformation of one thing into another without cutting it For example if we imagine a stretchy object then all the shapes we can stretch or twist it into are Homotopy equivalence homotopy equivalent One famous example is the homotopy equivalence of a coffee cup and a donut To a topologist these two shapes are the same
