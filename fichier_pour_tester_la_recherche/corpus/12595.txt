In physiology transduction is the change of a stimulus from one form to another Transduction in the nervous system typically means synapse synaptic events where an electricity electrical signal is converted into a chemical one by the release of neurotransmitter s In signal transduction sensory transduction a chemical or physical stimulus is transduced by sensory receptor s into an electrical signal For example in the visual system sensory cells called rod and cone cell s in the retina change the physical energy of light signals into electrical impulses that travel to the brain The light causes a change in a protein called rhodopsin In mammalian examples more light hitting the receptor results in the transduction of a signal into fewer electrical impulses In invertebrates however more rhodopsin activation results in increased frequency of neuron firing
