In chemistry a property is any aspect of a chemical substance substance which is only seen by means of a chemical reaction Simply speaking chemical properties cannot be determined just by viewing or touching the substance This is different from a physical property which can be discovered without changing the substance s chemical structure Usually a chemical property is discovered by changing the substance s internal structure When a substance goes under a chemical reaction the properties will change drastically resulting in chemical change However a catalytic property would also be a chemical property Chemical properties can be used for building chemical classifications They can be used to identify an unknown substance or to separate or purify it from other substances
