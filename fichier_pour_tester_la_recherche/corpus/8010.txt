A capacitor is an Electronics electronic device that stores electric energy It is similar to a battery but is smaller lightweight and charges up much quicker Capacitors are used in many electronic devices today and can be made out of many different types of material The Leyden jar was one of the first capacitors invented Capacitors are usually made with two metal plates that are on top of each other and near each other but that do not actually touch When powered they allow energy to be stored inside an electrical field Because the plates need a lot of area to store even a small amount of charge the plates are usually rolled up into some other shape such as a cylinder Sometimes other shapes of capacitors are used for special purposes A capacitor like effect can also result just from two Electrical conductor conductors being close to each other whether you want it to exist or not The type of capacitor used depends on the application Capacitors come in many sizes They can be as small as an ant or as large as a dustbin A few capacitors are adjustable All capacitors have two connections or leads Most kinds of capacitors can be changed around easily by someone who has basic skills in electronics However one of the more powerful types the electrolytic capacitor must be used the correct way or they can explode violently While capacitors do have similarities to batteries in that they can store energy as mentioned earlier capacitors can also release all their stored energy very quickly even faster than a second A charging and discharging defibrillator or a photoflash capacitor is a good example of how a capacitor gradually charges up until it can not be filled any more and then quickly discharges its stored power to a device that needs to have it quickly
