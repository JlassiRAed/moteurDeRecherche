In anatomy a ganglion is a mass of tissue in the nervous system It is a group of neuron nerve cells which act as a wikt junction junction between different parts of the nervous system With invertebrate s ganglia often do the work of a brain In these cases like the earthworm there is a ganglion above the gut at the front This is linked to another under the gut by nerve fibre s running down each side of the gut The rest of the central nervous system runs under the gut This type of arrangement in found in a number of invertebrate phyla and contrasts with the vertebrate s who have their spinal cord above their gut In another usage ganglion cells are found in the retina of the vertebrate eye
