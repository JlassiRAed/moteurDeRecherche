An oligosaccharide is a polymer of a few different simple sugar s Oligosacchardides are carbohydrate s When they are hydrolysis hydrolized oligosaccharides give to monosaccharides oligosacharides arre formed when to monosaccharide units cmbine with each other by the loss of water molecules resulting in the formation of glycosidic linkageConversly hydrolysis of an oligosaccharide in water in the presence of an acid or enzyme yields to monosaccharide units Those oligosaccharides which consist of two monosaccharides units are called as disaccharide Those oligosaccharides containing monosaccharides units are called as Trisaccharides E G Raffinose C H O
