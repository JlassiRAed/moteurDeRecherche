 Eudimorphodon is a recently discovered pterosaur and comes from shale laid down Upper Triassic Rock rocks in Italy A nearly complete skeleton was found in This showed it was a member of the long tailed sub order of pterosaurs the Rhamphorhynchoidea Eudimorphodon was small in size with teeth packed into a jaw only cms long Teeth at the front are fangs further back the teeth are small and multipointed many with five cusps This is wikt unique unique among pterosaurs whose teeth are usually of a simple cone conical form Stomach contents showed it had eaten a small fish Parapholidophorus The top and bottom teeth of Eudimorphodon came into direct contact with each other when the jaws were closed especially at the back of the jaw The teeth were multi cusped and tooth wear shows that Eudimorphodon was able to crush or chew its food to some degree Wear along the sides of these teeth suggests that Eudimorphodon also fed on hard shelled invertebrate s Juvenile Eudimorphodon had somewhat different and fewer teeth and may have eaten insect s An unsolved puzzle is the flexibility of the tail which lacks the very long stiffening vertebra l extensions other long tailed pterosaurs have This flexibility is a basal Trait trait its functional significance in this genus is unknown However it is known that the stiffened tail of Rhamphorhynchus like pterosaurs is a device which adds wikt stability stability to their flight Without this stability the animal would be more wikt manoeuvre manoeuvrable but their flight would need more control by the brain
