A Tropical Upper Tropospheric Trough tropics Its formation is usually caused by the expansion of the Trough of Westerlies Wind to the tropics It can also develop from the inverted trough adjacent to a upper level anticyclone TUTTs are different from mid latitude troughs in the sense that they are maintained by subsidence warming near the tropopause which balances radiation cooling TUTTs sometimes bring a large amount of vertical wind shear over tropical wave tropical disturbances and tropical cyclone cyclones so TUTTs can reduce cyclone development But there are also times when TUTTs help start tropical cyclones or make them stronger by providing additional forced ascent near the storm center and an efficient outflow channel in the upper troposphere Moreover under specific circumstances TUTTs can grow into upper cold lows and may enhance the development of low level disturbances
