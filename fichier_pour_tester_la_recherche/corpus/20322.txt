In probability theory and statistics the median is a number This number has the property that it divides a set of observed values in two equal halves so that half of the values are below it and half are above If there are a finite number of elements the median is easy to find The values need to be arranged in a list lowest to highest If there is an odd number of values the median is the one at position For example if there are values they can be arranged into two groups of with the median in between at position With an even number of values as there is no single number which divides all of the numbers to two halves the median is defined as the mean of the two central elements With observations this would be the mean of elements and which is their sum divided by Alternatively the median of an even sized list is sometimes defined as either of the two middle elements the choice being either does not have that disadvantage but it is more difficult to do It also has the disadvantage that the same list of values does not have a well defined deterministic median
