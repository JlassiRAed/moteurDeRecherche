 Mount Garibaldi is an eroded dacitic strato volcano in southwestern British Columbia Both Garibaldi and Mount Baker to its south are part of the Cascade volcanic arc Mount Garibaldi km due north of Vancouver is made up of Mount Garibaldi Atwell Peak and Dalton Dome This Pleistocene volcanic center is part of a volcanic field that contains some vents in an area km long by km wide much of which is in Garibaldi Provincial Park The eruptive history of Mt Garibaldi involves an initial period of volcanism thick The steep northern edge of the Rubble Creek flow party collapsed several times most recently in the village of Garibaldi was abandoned because of the danger of future collapses The most recent period of activity occurred shortly after the disappearance of the glacial ice filling the valley to radiocarbon years ago and ended with the eruption the Ring Creek lava flow from Opal cone on Garibaldi s southeastern flank The Ring Creek flow is very unusual It is km long a length usually only attained by basalt flows except that the Ring Creek flow is dacite Renewed volcanism in the Garibaldi area would pose a serious threat to the local communities of Whistler and Squamish Although noPlinian style eruptions are known even Pelean type eruptions could produce large quantities of ash that could rise to several hundred meters above the volcano As it is close to Vancouver this would make it a hazard for air traffic The danger from lava flows would be low to moderate because the nature of the lavas would prevent them from travelling far from their source even though the Ring Creek lava flow ends only km from Squamish Melting of remnant glacial ice capping the Mt Garibaldi area could produce floods lahars or debris flows that might endanger small communities including Brackendale Highway which links Whistler and Squamish with Vancouver is already plagued by landslides and dedris flows from the precipitous Coast Mountains An eruption producing floods could destroy segments of the highway Flooding and debris flows could also have serious coneequences for the salmon fishery on the Squamish Cheakamus and Mamquam rivers In addition explosive eruptions and the accompanying ash could cause short and long term water supply problems for Vancouver and much of the lower mainland The catchment area for the Greater Vancouver watershed is downwind from the Garibaldi area Air fall material could also have a deleterious effect on the ice fields to the east of Mt Garibaldi causing increased melting and spring flooding This in turn could theaten water supplies from Pitt Lake as well as fisheries on the Pitt River
