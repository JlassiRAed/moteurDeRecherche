 Heliocentrism is the idea that the Earth and other planet s revolve around the Sun which is the center of the solar system Before Copernicus most people thought that the Sun and the other planets revolved around the Earth This gave his reasons for thinking the Sun was at the center instead Other astronomer s who made further advances after Copernicus were Johannes Kepler and Galileo Galilei For example Kepler showed that the planets do not orbit in perfect circles and Galileo built very good telescope s that helped to confirm the heliocentric model Copernicus also thought that the sun was the center of the universe but we now know that this is incorrect The Sun is part of the Milky Way galaxy which is one out of billions of galaxies
