In Particle physics physics an elementary particle or fundamental particle is a particle that might not be made of other particles An elementary particle can be a fermion or a boson Fermions are the building blocks of matter and have mass while bosons behave as force carriers for fermion interactions and some of them have no mass The Standard Model is the most accepted way to explain how particles behave and the forces that affect them According to this model the elementary particles are further grouped into quarks leptons and gauge bosons with the Higgs boson having a special status Of the particles that make up an atom only the electron is an elementary particle Protons and neutrons are made of quarks There are three basic properties that describe an elementary particle mass charge and spin Each property is assigned a number value For mass and charge the number can be zero For example a photon has zero mass and a neutrino has zero charge These properties always stay the same for an elementary particle Mass and charge are properties we see in everyday life because gravity and electricity affect things that humans see and touch But spin affects only the world of subatomic particle s so it cannot be directly observed
