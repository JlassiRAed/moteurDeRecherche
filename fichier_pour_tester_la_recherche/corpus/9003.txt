The Emancipation Proclamation was an order by U S President Abraham Lincoln to free Slavery slaves in states It applied to slaves in the Confederate States of America states still in rebellion in during the American Civil War It did not actually immediately free all slaves in those states because those areas were still controlled by the Confederacy It did however free at least slaves immediately and nearly all million slaves as the Union army advanced into Confederate states Until the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution in only the states had power to end slavery within their own borders Thus Lincoln issued the Proclamation as a war measure in his role as commander in chief The Proclamation made emancipation a goal of the Civil War It also weakened efforts within England and France to officially recognize the Confederacy As Union troops advanced into Rebel territory they freed thousands of slaves per day Many did not wait but fled their owners to claim their freedom Five slave states had remained loyal to the Union and were not at war with the Federal government of the United States federal government Thus Lincoln did not have authority to free slaves in those states and so this Proclamation was not applied in those states The Proclamation also did not apply to Tennessee nor to areas within Virginia and Louisiana which Union forces already controlled
