 Probability theory is the branch of mathematics concerned with analysis of random phenomena The central objects of probability theory are random variable s stochastic process es and event events mathematical abstractions of determinism non deterministic events or measured quantities that may either be single occurrences or happen over time in an apparently random fashion As a mathematical foundation for statistics probability theory is essential to many human activities that involve quantitative analysis of large sets of data Methods of probability theory also apply to description of complex systems given only partial knowledge of their state as in statistical mechanics A great discovery of twentieth century physics was the probabilistic nature of physical phenomena at atomic scales described in quantum mechanics
