This essay WP Avoiding MediaWiki expansion depth limit covers issues about the MediaWiki version expansion depth limit for the nesting of WP template template s and if logic All during the nesting limit has been only a mere levels of nested if then else and keep going as if nothing were wrong The technical limits of expansion depth are explained in the pages m Help Expansion depth m Help Expansion Expansion depth limit at Meta wikimedia orgThe limits were chosen to thwart denial of service attacks being caused by very large or complex templates What is not affected Typically large templates can be invoked together in article text without reaching the limit The main worry is when using large templates inside an Help Infobox infobox or deeper inside the markup of other templates For example the large template Template Convert Convert can be used with Template Str left str left to show the length of meters Using large templates together in an article paragraph is rarely a problem Reducing expansion depth The nest levels can be reduced inside large templates by rewriting some of the nested if else if else logic as non nested if then if then if then or using a switch outside of the if then logic In some cases avoiding the use of other templates inside a template can also reduce the nesting whereas using a ifexpr increases the depth by level invoking another template containing that ifexpr increases depth by levels Putting a default value in a parameter does NOT increase the nesting level are both at zero levels of nesting
