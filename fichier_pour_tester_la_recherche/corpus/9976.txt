 Stingy Jack is a character in Irish people Irish folklore He was a poor dirty man who was often drunk He outsmarted the devil at least three times He invited the devil to have a drink with him Jack did not want to pay for the drink He persuaded the devil to change himself into a coin The devil did so and Jack put the coin in his pocket There was a silver cross in his pocket that made it impossible for the devil to return to his original shape Jack eventually allowed the devil to resume his shape but only after he promised not to bother Jack for a whole year and to not try to claim his soul when he died On another occasion Jack persuaded the devil to climb an apple tree to gather apples Jack quickly carved crosses into the trunk of the tree making it impossible for the devil to come down Jack allowed the devil to come down but only after he promised not to bother Jack for ten years and not to claim his soul when he died On the third occasion Jack died before the ten year time limit God did not want Jack in Heaven so he was sent to Hell The devil could not claim his soul so Jack was sent back into the world The devil gave him a glowing coal to light his way in the darkness Jack put the coal into a hollowed out turnip He is said to still walk the earth with his lantern and can be seen around All Saints Day November Jack became known as Jack of the lantern This name was shortened to Jack o lantern In the United States his lantern became a pumpkin rather than a turnip Pumpkins were common in the U S and easier to carve The story of Jack is little known perhaps because he was an unsuitable role model for entertaining children
