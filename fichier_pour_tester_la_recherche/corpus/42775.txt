An electric fish is a fish that can make electric field s Fishes that can generate such fields are said to be electrogenic those that can detect them are called electroreception electroreceptive Most electrogenic fish are also electroreceptive Many fish for example shark s ray s and catfish es are electroreceptive They cannot generate electric fields though and are therefore not classified as electric fish Most bony fish are neither electrogenic nor electroreceptive
