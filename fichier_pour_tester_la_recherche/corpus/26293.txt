An integrated circuit into which a very complex electronic circuit is etched using photographic techniques Silicon chips can contain computer processors computer memory memory and special devices The chip is very fragile and so is normally surrounded by a tough plastic package and electrical contact with the chip is provided through metal legs sticking out of the package There are two main advantages of ICs over discrete circuits cost and performance Cost is low because millions of transistors are printed as a complete unit by photolithography and not constructed as one transistor at a time Performance is higher since the components switch quickly consuming little power ICs are designed for different purposes A chip may be designed as a calculator which only works as a calculator Integrated circuits can be classified into analog signal analog digital signal digital and mixed signal
