The law of non contradiction is a rule of logic It states that if something is true then the opposite of it is false For example if an animal is a cat the same animal cannot be not a cat Or stated in logic if p then not p p cannot be p at the same time and in the same sense The law was stated as a principle of mathematical logic by Russell and Whitehead in Principia Mathematica Ravi Zacharias has said most eastern philosophies reject the law of noncontradiction The idea of noncontradiction is rejected in some strands of Buddhism
