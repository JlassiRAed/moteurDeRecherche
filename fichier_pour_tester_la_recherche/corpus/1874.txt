A checksum is a number It is a kind of redundancy check There are different ways to calculate it It serves as a check that no errors have been made when writing down the number In its simplest form the numerical digit digits are simply added up This can however not detect errors of swapping digits around Better ways of calculating a checksum are to use a Hamming code a cyclic redundancy check or modular arithmetic One of the uses of checksums is to check that account numbers have been entered correctly Portuguese bank account identifiers are a good example of how checksums work They have digit s The first digits identify the bank branch and account number The last two digits are mod checksum digits based on modular arithmetic A typical Portuguese bank account number is The digits have the following meanings The digits represent the bank The digits represent the branch of the bank The digits represent the account number The digits represent the checksum If is divide d by the answer is remainder Since the remainder is the bank account identifier is probably correct If the person writing down the number missed a digit swapped two digits around or wrote a digit down incorrectly the remainder would not have been If this is the case then the computer should detect an error and give an error error message Another place where checksums are used are serial number s for computer software
