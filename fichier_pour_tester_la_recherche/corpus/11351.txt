 Toner is a powder commonly used in photocopier s and Laser printer s to draw images and text onto paper The early forms of toner were just carbon powder In early machines the user had to pour the toner into a reservoir on the machine itself Current machines feed from a sealed Ink cartridge cartridge which is normally a proprietary design Although manufacturers try to make the process complicated empty cartridges are sometimes refilled by third party vendors Toner particles are melted by the heat of the fuser and bind to the paper
