The One s complement is an operation that can be done to binary number s It is obtained by swapping all the bit s in the number that is replacing with or with In many systems this is used to represent the inverse of a number One of the big problems that occur when using One s complement is that the number zero has two representations either all s or all s Using digits both and represent zero This problem can be solved by using Two s complement
