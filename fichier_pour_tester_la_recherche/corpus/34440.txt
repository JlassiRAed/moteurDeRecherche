 Econometrics is a branch of economics It is the use of statistical and mathematical methods to describe the relation between economic forces such as Capital labor Much of econometrics is making Mathematical model model s which are simple pictures of the real world These models then can be used to predict what will happen in the real world An example of econometrics would be looking at the prices of house s in a town An economist can try to make a simple picture of the house prices in the town This picture might show that houses close to the market are worth more An economist could then say that if a new market is made in another part of the town home prices there might go up The economist also might say that the new market could make prices less than before near the old one because the new market will make it so that more houses are near a market This would make the people who sell houses near a market sell them for less since there could be more sellers than buyers
