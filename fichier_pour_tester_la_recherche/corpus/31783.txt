A thial or thioaldehyde is any molecule with the functional group group RCH It is like an aldehyde with the oxygen atom changed with a sulfur The sulfur has a double bond to carbon It also keeps two lone pair s Thials are very reactive because they are very good electrophile s It is difficult to make one because they will react with themselves as soon as they are formed They can do Diels Alder reaction s very quickly However if steric effects bulky R groups are used the thial might be more stable If the H is changed with another R group then the molecule is called a thioketone These are more stable
