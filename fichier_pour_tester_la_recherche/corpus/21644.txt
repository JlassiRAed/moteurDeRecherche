 Chembox Hypobromite is an ion Its chemical formula is BrO It contains bromine in its oxidation state It is an oxidizing agent It is similar to hypochlorite Hypobromites are the salt s of hypobromous acid Hypobromite is a disinfectant Some white blood cell s oxidation oxidize bromide to hypobromite with peroxide and use the hypobromite to kill germs Bromides can be added to pools along with chlorine to make hypobromite which disinfects the pools Hypobromites are made by dissolving bromine in a base basic solution Hypobromite disproportionation disproportionates to bromate and bromide when heated
