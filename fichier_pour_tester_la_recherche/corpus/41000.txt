 Digital signal processing is concerned with the processing of digital signal s or analog signal s after converting from Analog to digital converter analog to digital format DSP includes subfields like communication signals processing radar signal processing sensor array processing digital image processing etc DSP is usually used with Analog signal real world analog signals found in our lives the first step is usually to convert the signal from an analog to a digital form by using an analog to digital converter Often the required output signal is another Analog signal real world analog signal which requires a digital to analog converter Digital signal processing algorithm s can run on General purpose microprocessor s and standard computer s Specialized processors called digital signal processor s Purpose built hardware such as application specific integrated circuit Digital Signal Controller s Stream processing that works very well for traditional DSP or Graphics processing unit graphics processing applications
