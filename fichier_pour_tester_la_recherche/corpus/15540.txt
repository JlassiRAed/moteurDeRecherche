The Atacama Desert is a desert It is on the Tropic of Capricorn in northern Chile and is one of the driest places on earth In some places less than an inch of rain falls every ten years Only one of the rivers from the Andes mountains reaches the ocean through the desert The rest disappear into the dry soil The Atacama is a desert not because mountain s make a rain shadow but because the ocean does In parts of this desert it has not rain ed for over years Even though the Atacama is the driest place in the world that does not mean it is the hottest The Atacama Desert is actually a really cold place with temperatures ranging from to degrees The oldest known artificially prepared mummies come from this desert They are called the Chinchorro mummies
