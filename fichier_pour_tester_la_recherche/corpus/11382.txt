The Permian Triassic extinction event was the largest extinction event in the Phanerozoic eon of all marine species and of terrestrial vertebrates became extinct It ended the Palaeozoic era and began the Mesozoic era The event forms the boundary between the Permian and Triassic periods at about million years ago The pattern of extinction is still unclear There are several proposed mechanisms for the extinctions These include large or multiple meteorite impacts increased volcanoes volcanism sudden release of methane hydrates from the sea floor Gradual changes include sea level change oceanic anoxic event s increasing arid ity and a shift in ocean circulation driven by climate change One thing is probably significant One of the largest ever flood basalt eruptions took place across the P Tr junction These eruptions from to million years ago produced the Siberian Traps a huge volcanic province in Siberia This would certainly have made the world s climate much worse and is now thought to be the main cause of this great extinction
