 Bes was the ancient Egypt ian god of protection of pregnant women newborn babies and the family He was a dwarf wearing a lion s skin Bes does not look like he is Egyptian He is like gods found in other parts of Africa To scare away demon s during birth Bes would dance around the room shaking his rattle and yelling to scare away demons that might put a curse on the child After the child was born Bes would stay by him her When a baby laughed or smile d for no reason Egyptians believed that Bes was somewhere in the room making funny faces His name appears to be connected to a Nubian word for cat besa which literally means protector Egyptians kept cats in order to attack snake s and creatures that might ruin crop stores such as mice and so Bes was naturally singled out as worthy of worship in Egypt
