 Cell division is the process by which a cell called the parent cell divides into two cells called daughter cells When the cell divides everything inside it divides also The Cell nucleus nucleus and the chromosome s divide and the mitochondria divide also In mitosis an ordinary body cell divides to make two daughter cells In meiosis a cell divides twice to produce four gametes The first division of meiosis is a special kind of cell division called a reduction division because the number of chromosomes is halved The second division of meiosis is similar to mitosis Cells are the building blocks of life and cell division is a basic feature of life For simple unicellular organism s like Amoebozoa one cell division reproduces the entire organism On a larger scale cell division can create offspring from multicellular organisms such as plants that grow from cuttings But most importantly cell division enables organisms that are able to sexual reproduction sexually reproduce to develop from the one celled fertilised egg Cell division also allows for continual renewal and repair of the organism
