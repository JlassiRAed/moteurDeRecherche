 Hydrobromic acid is an acid Its chemical formula is HBr It is a very strong acid It is used to make bromide s by reaction with metal s or metal oxide s It can be made by reacting bromine sulfur dioxide and water This reaction makes hydrobromic acid and sulfuric acid It is made by dissolving hydrogen bromide in water It can also be made by reacting bromine with sulfur and phosphorus It can also be made by electrolysis of a bromide solution It can be made by reacting bromides with non oxidizing agent oxidizing acids because oxidizing acids would turn the bromides into bromine
