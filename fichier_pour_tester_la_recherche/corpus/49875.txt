A supercontinent is a large area of land which has more than one continent al core or craton They are formed by continental plate s coming together Continental plates have periodically collided and assembled in periods of orogeny to form supercontinents The cycle of supercontinents forming breaking up separating and re forming through plate tectonics happens about every million years Eurasia is certainly a supercontinent but the Americas are usually thought of as separate continent s Even more clearly Gondwana and Laurasia were supercontinents formed by the breakup of the global supercontinent Pangaea The land bridge between North America North and South America is geology geologically a rather temporary connection Because of this the Americas are usually not described as one supercontinent
