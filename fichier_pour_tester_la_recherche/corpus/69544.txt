A computer based model is a computer program that is designed to simulation simulate what might or what did happen in a situation They are used in many ways including in astronomy economics and science s such as physics and biology Computer models are used in fields such as earthquake performance simulation and making building model models of buildings Well known areas which use computer models Computer modelling often uses numerical analysis to approximation approximate the real solution of the problem Simulation techniques are then used to get values Numerical weather prediction s are too inaccurate to give a good local prediction of the weather so other methods are used to adjust them
