 Squealer is a porker on Manor Farm in the book Animal Farm Squealer is a very fat little piglet with round cheeks twinkling eyes nimble movements coupled together with a shrill voice While arguing a difficult point he skips from side to side and whisks his tail around in a persuasive manner allowing him to lie with ease The pig is seen as the propagandist in the book and his ability to use language well makes his speeches believable by the other less intelligent animals Squealer is based on the Russia media of Stalin s time and all the advertisement of Stalin
