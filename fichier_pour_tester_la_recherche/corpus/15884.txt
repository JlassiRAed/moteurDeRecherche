Lesbian gay bisexual and transgender persons in Turkey may face legal challenges not experienced by non LGBT residents Homosexuality is legal in the Republic of Turkey but the law does not include sexual orientation or gender identity in its civil rights laws and there is no legal recognition for same sex couples But sexual reassignment surgery is allowed and legal sex change is possible since Turkey tends to be socially conservative when it comes to such issues as homosexuality
