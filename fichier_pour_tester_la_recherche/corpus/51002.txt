An intrusion is magma which cools and becomes solid under the Earth s surface It occurs when there are lines of weakness such as fault s joint s or strata bedding plane s in the crust Then magma enters these lines of weakness By contrast an extrusion is magma which cools into rock above the surface of the Earth s crust crust Both intrusive and extrusive rocks are classed as igneous rock s The process of forming intrusive rocks may take millions of years As the rock slowly cools into a solid the different parts of the magma Crystallization crystallize into minerals The crystals are usually larger than in extrusive rocks Many mountain ranges such as the Sierra Nevada formations Intrusions vary widely from mountain range sized batholith s to thin vein like fracture fillings When exposed by erosion these cores called batholiths may occupy huge areas of Earth s surface Large bodies of magma that solidify underground before they reach the surface of the crust are called pluton s Intrusive structures may go between strata bedding planes of earlier country rock A Sill dyke is an intrusion which moves up crossing older strata
