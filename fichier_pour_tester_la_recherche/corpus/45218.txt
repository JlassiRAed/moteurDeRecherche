The retina is the thin layer of cells that lines the back of the eye ball in humans and in many animals It is made mainly of neuron s and its role is to sense the light which gets into the eye and send information about it to the brain Most information about light that leaves the retina travels through the optic nerve and is used by the brain for sight Information about light which travels through the retino hypothamalic tract is for adjusting circadian rhythm s to the hour day The center of the human retina called the fovea has the most rod cell s and cone cell s for receiving light Even though the fovea takes up only square millimeters it plays the most important roles in vision It is only around of the human retina but the fovea sends about as much information to the visual cortex as the rest of the retina combined
