The Zuiderzeewerken are a system of dam s land reclamation and sewer water drainage works in the Netherlands during the th century twentieth century Plans for the works date back to the s but it was not until a very bad flood in that the Dutch people Dutch parliament finally agreed to pay for the works Now it is one of the Seven Wonders of the Modern World First some dams or Dike dykes were built to separate the South Sea long When it was finished in the South Sea was completely cut off and from then on would become a lake called the IJsselmeer Land reclamation meant building more dams and pumping out the water inside The new land is called a polder Polders make new land for agriculture and make flood protection better because the lake is smaller There are gates and sluices at the ends of the Afsluitdijk The gates called Lock locks can be opened to let ship s through The sluices let water out of the IJsselmeer If there were no sluices the lake would fill up and flood the countryside This is because it is always being filled with water from rivers and the polders which are still being drained
