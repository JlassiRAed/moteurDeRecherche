 Hi guys Here s my eighth article for Simple News You may have noticed I haven t been so active lately this is because I am not really motivated to edit any more I really c an t see any improvement being made and this just saddens me We ve tried to start collaboration projects but it seems all of them have failed I would therefore like to ask for a discussion about this on Simple Talk We have to make a project that works that s well organized and that has a specific aim Maybe an anti stub team whose aim is to make stubs into articles or a simplification team who simplifies articles or even just keep the collaboration team whose objective is to make certain articles GAs and VGAs by sharing out the work Please this is an absolutely necessary thing otherwise I don t see how we re going to make any progress It s Summer you ll probably be on holiday and that ll give you more free time to edit More to come from Simple news in the next editions June UTC
