 Normal force is the force that the ground pushes back up with If there was no normal force you d be slowly seeping into the ground The normal force on a object is always Right angle perpendicular to the surface the object is on On a flat surface the normal force of an object is On an inclined plane the normal force is reduced by the angle and the normal force is Note that on a flat surface would be So the two equations are equal
