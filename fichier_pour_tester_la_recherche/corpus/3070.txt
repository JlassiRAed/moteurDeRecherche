 Regeneration means that an organism regrows a lost part so that the original function is restored It is a term in developmental biology The ability to regenerate differs in different groups Whereas newt s for example can regenerate severed limbs mammal s cannot Limb regeneration in newts occurs in two major steps first de Cellular differentiation differentiation of adult cells into a stem cell state similar to embryonic cells and second developmental biology development of these cells into new tissue more or less the same way it developed the first time Simpler animals like flatworm s can regenerate because the adults retain clusters of stem cells in their bodies These can migrate to damaged parts of the body then divide and differentiate to provide the missing tissue
