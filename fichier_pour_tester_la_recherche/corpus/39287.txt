 Migration is when animal s move on a regular cycle For example caribou in the Arctic go south in winter and return in summer when it is warmer Many bird s migrate such as geese and stork s Migration is the travelling of long distances in search of a new habitat The wikt trigger trigger for the migration may be local climate local availability of food or the season of the year To be counted as a true migration and not just a local dispersal the movement should be an annual or seasonal event Many birds fly to warmer places for the winter as do some insect s such as the migratory locust Young Atlantic salmon leave the river of their birth when they have reached a few inches in size Many species in the sea have a daily migration Plankton go up for the day where there is light and down at night where they are less easy to find The many species which feed on them follow them up and down Migration is an evolution ary force This is because it is a major source of natural selection The success or failure of individual animals to make the journey is usually needed for them to reproduce Many parts of the world have a strongly seasonal climate In order to survive many species need to breed in one place and later eat in another place The simplest example is the African herbivore s who follow the growth of grass in East Africa This region has seasonal rainfall and so it has seasonal growth of grass Their predator s follow them
