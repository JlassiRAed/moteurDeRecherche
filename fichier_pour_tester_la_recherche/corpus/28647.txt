A skeleton key is a key that can open all of the lock s in the set For example in an office building each employee would have a key that only opens his her office and the manager or owner would have a key that opens all of the offices in that building More complicated setups are also possible For example if there are janitor s in the office building and each janitor only cleans a particular floor the janitor for a particular floor could have a sub master key that opens only the offices on that floor while each employee still has a key that opens only his her office and the manager still has a key that opens all of the doors The exterior doors might also be configured so that they can be opened by any employee key janitor key or the manager s master key The more complicated the setup the more important it is to use locks that have a large number of key possibilities Disc detainer lock s are especially suitable for master keying due to their large number of key possibilities
