For computers a character is a letter number or punctuation mark that can be shown on a screen or printed There are also some unseen characters called control characters An example of a control character is the carriage return or line feed that tells the software to start a new line A glyph is the shape of the character that is seen when put on screen or on paper Since computers only use number s they use number code s to represent characters For example in ASCII the number represents the letter A The computer knows when working in ASCII to put the glyph for A on the screen when it sees the number The glyph can change shape slightly depending on the font that is used if it is bold or in italics etc But it is still stored as a in the computer that does not change
