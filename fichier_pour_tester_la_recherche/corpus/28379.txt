In physics torque is the tendency of a Force spin an object or to stop an object from spinning a torque is made The force applied to a lever multiplied by the distance from the lever s fulcrum multiplied again by the sine of the angle created is described as torque This is also known as r cross product cross f or force times fulcrum distance times sine theta
