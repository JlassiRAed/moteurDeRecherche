 Deep level tube lines were built by tunnelling shields and are tunnels that are deep underground that allow trains to run through them They are commonly found on the London Underground An example is the Victoria line Bakerloo Central Jubilee Northern Piccadilly Victoria and Waterloo City lines are the deep level lines They are very hard to find air ventilation as they are the deepest But the very deepest line is the northern line On the northern line it is absolutely difficult to replace the train as it is ultimately the deepest line in the entire network Subject to that the ventilation is very difficult and there is not a lot of fans that are there to cool the trains down Even in the event of a emergency the people trapped on board cannot get off due to the insufficient space inside the tunnel compared to the subsurface line
