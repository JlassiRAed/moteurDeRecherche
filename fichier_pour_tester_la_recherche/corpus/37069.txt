 Algebraic topology is a branch of mathematics that uses tools from abstract algebra to study topological space s Algebraic topology can be used in a number of other fields such as physics branches of geometry and number theory Algebraic topology can be used to count holes in a shape for example a wedding ring and a hollow pipe both have one hole but a figure has two This can also be done in different dimensions the sphere has a kind of dimensional hole
