 Heisenberg s uncertainty principle is one of the most important results of twentieth century physics It relates to measurements of sub atomic particle s Certain pairs of measurements such as cannot be precisely pinned down Albert Einstein thought that such a Quantum physics quantum theory could give us only a partial description of nature He thought that Heisenberg s discovery showed that human knowledge is limited but he also thought that nature is absolute That is he thought that there is no uncertainty in nature and that the uncertainty exists only in our knowledge about it However many other scientists disagree with Einstein Heisenberg s idea is that if something like an electron were shot into a big box with a certain speed and in a certain direction then it would be possible to calculate a fairly accurate idea of what its path would be like in the future However if the box were made smaller then we would have a more certain idea of where it was located and because of that we would have to have a less certain idea of how it was traveling American physicist Brian Greene gave the analogy of a moth which flies placidly around in a large closet but who flies frantically back and forth and up and down when placed in a glass jar In the animation to the right you can see a faint white puff on the right side of the wall after a big puff hits the wall from the left That dim spot of light represents the photon or other atomic particle which tunnels through the wall The minimum range of error in position is at a minimum about equal to the Planck constant
