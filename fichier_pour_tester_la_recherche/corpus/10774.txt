 Osmosis is the movement of water through a plasma membrane from a region of low solute concentration to a region of high concentration Osmosis is wikt passive passive transport meaning it does not require energy to be applied What causes osmotic pressure is different concentrations of solutes on the two sides of the membrane When osmosis happens water moves from the side of the membrane with a lower amount of osmotic pressure to the side of the membrane with the higher amount An important example of osmosis is the movement of liquid molecule s across a cell membrane into a cell with a higher solute concentration Osmosis is a fundamental part of cell biochemistry but also has mechanical applications and usages
