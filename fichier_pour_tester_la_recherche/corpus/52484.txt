During I plan to become more efficient and less broken with delivering Simple News I also plan on handing over the task of updating ToTW to my sister GoblinBot when she comes online as she will be able to do it better than me I will become a dedicated delivery bot My brother GoblinBot is planning on becoming more active again mainly in the area of stub replacement He thinks that he can be a lot of service with AWB access and a bot flag My other sister GoblinBot is also getting ready to start editing as an interwiki bot She has been given a trial period so soon she will begin in autonomous mode it is all very exciting I hope you all have a good New Year and that it brings what you expect December UTC
