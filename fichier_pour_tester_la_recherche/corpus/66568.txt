An irregular galaxy is a galaxy that does not have a distinct regular shape like a spiral galaxy spiral or an elliptical galaxy Irregular galaxies do not fall into any of the regular types of the Hubble sequence They do not have a wikt bulge bulge in the centre nor any trace of spiral structure They are quite common they may make up a quarter of all galaxies Most were once spiral or elliptical galaxies but were deformed by gravitational pull Irregular galaxies also contain abundant amounts of gas and dust There are three sorts of irregular galaxies An Irr I galaxy is an irregular galaxy that features some structure but not enough to place it cleanly into the Hubble sequence Some of the irregular galaxies are small spiral galaxies that are being distorted by the gravity of a larger neighbour An Irr II galaxy is an irregular galaxy that does not appear to feature any structure that can place it into the Hubble sequence Dwarf irregulars Grebel Eva K The evolutionary history of Local Group irregular galaxies In McWilliam Andrew Rauch Michael version of the Faint blue galaxy faint blue galaxies known to exist in Hubble Ultra Deep Field deep field galaxy surveys The Magellanic Clouds Magellanic Cloud galaxies were once classified as irregular galaxies but have since been found to contain barred spiral structures
