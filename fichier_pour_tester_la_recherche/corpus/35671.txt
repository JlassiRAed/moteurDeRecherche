Dictyosteliidae Dictyostelium Polysphondylium Coenonia Actyosteliidae Acytostelium The dictyostelids are a group of cellular slime mold s or social amoeba e They are very unusual eukaryote organisms For much of their life they live as separate cells Then in hard times they come together to reproduce as a fruiting body The fruiting body produces spores with protective walls They survive and open up in better times So these organisms are both unicellular and multicellular As separate amoebae they feed and divide normally They mostly eat soil bacteria When the food supply runs out they come together to form a kind of slug like thing The slug has a definite front and rear It responds to light and temperature differences and has the ability to move Under the right conditions the slug becomes a Sporocarp A stalk holds up one or more balls of spores These spores are inactive cells protected by tough cell walls They become new amoebae once food is available Dictyostelium has been used as a model organism in molecular biology and genetics It is studied as an example of cell communication Cellular differentiation differentiation and programmed cell death Research on Dictyostelium is available on line at dictyBase dictyBase
