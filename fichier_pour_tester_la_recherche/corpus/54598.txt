A cylinder is one of the most basic curved geometric shapes with the surface formed by the points at a fixed distance from a given line segment known as the axis of the cylinder The shape can be thought of as a Circle circular prism Both the surface and the solid shape created inside can be called a cylinder The surface area and the volume of a cylinder have been known since ancient times In differential geometry a cylinder is defined more broadly as any ruled surface which is spanned by a one parameter family of parallel lines A cylinder whose Cross section cross section is an ellipse parabola or hyperbola is called an elliptic cylinder parabolic cylinder or hyperbolic cylinder respectively
