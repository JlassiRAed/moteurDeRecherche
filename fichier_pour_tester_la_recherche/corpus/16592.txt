 Minor planet designations are number name combinations given by the Minor Planet Center a part of the International Astronomical Union IAU They are used for dwarf planet s and small Solar System bodies such as asteroid s but not comet s They are given to a body once its orbit is secured and are unrelated to provisional designation s which are given when an object is found The two parts of a formal designation are a number historically given in a similar order to the order that it was found now given only after the orbit is secured a name either the name assigned by the astronomer who found it or more commonly the provisional designation It looks like this Sedna or The rule for Natural satellite moons of minor planets such as the formal designation Romulus is an extension of the Roman numeral convention that had been used on and off for the moons of the planets since Galileo s time Comets are also managed by the Minor Planet Center but use a different cataloguing system
