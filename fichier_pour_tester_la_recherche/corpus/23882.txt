In physics absolute zero Certain things can reach temperatures below absolute zero known as negative temperatures This is very difficult to do and only very small objects can reach negative temperatures It might seem absurd but things at negative temperatures are actually hotter than things at positive temperatures If something with a negative temperature comes in contact with a positive temperature object heat will go from the negative object to the positive This is because temperature is a trade off between energy and entropy If you add energy to a positive temperature object it will increase in entropy If you add energy to a negative temperature object it will decrease in entropy Many objects cannot achieve negative temperatures because adding energy to them will increase their entropy Only very small things discussed in quantum mechanics can reach this state
