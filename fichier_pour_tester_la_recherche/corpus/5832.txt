 Methanogens are microorganisms which produce methane as a metabolism metabolic byproduct in anoxic conditions They are archaea a different Domain domain from bacteria They are common in wetlands where they are responsible for marsh gas They are also common in the digestive tract s of many animals such as ruminant s and humans They are responsible for the methane content of belching in ruminants and flatulence in humans cite bookIn Marine biology marine sediment s methane is produced when sulfate s are depleted below the top layers Others are extremophile s found in environments such as hot spring s and submarine hydrothermal vents as well as in the solid rock of the Earth s crust kilometers below the surface Methanogens can convert acetic acid to methane in a fermentation process Do not confuse them with methanotroph s which use up methane for their carbon and energy requirements
