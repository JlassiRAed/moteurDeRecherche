The Iapetus Ocean existed in the Neo proterozoic and Palaeozoic era s The ocean was in the southern hemisphere between three paleocontinents The ocean disappeared when these three continents joined to form one big landmass That large continent has been given various names such as Laurussia or the Old Red Sandstone continent Probably the best name is Euramerica because basically it was American and Europe stuck together The Iapetus Ocean was between continental masses that would at a much later time roughly form the opposite shores of the Atlantic Ocean It was a kind of precursor of the Atlantic At the start of the century American paleontologist Charles Doolittle Walcott noticed differences in early Paleozoic benthic trilobite s either side of the line which later was called the Iapetus Suture The so called Pacific fauna of Laurentia as found in Scotland and western Newfoundland and Labrador Newfoundland was quite different from those of Baltica often called the Atlantic fauna The latter is found in the southern parts of the British Isles and eastern Newfoundland Geologists of the early century thought a large trough a so called geosyncline had existed between Scotland and England in the early Paleozoic keeping both sides separated With the development of plate tectonics in the s geologists concluded the Atlantic Ocean must have had a precursor before the time of Pangaea That ocean had closed as three continents joined producing the Iapetus Suture
