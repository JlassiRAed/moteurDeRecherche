 Archaeognatha is an order The name Archaeognatha is derived from Greek language Greek Archaeos meaning ancient and gnatha meaning mouthparts jaw This refers to the articulation of the mandible s which has a single condyle where all higher insects have two An alternate name Microcoryphia comes from the Greek micro meaning small and coryphia meaning head The Order Archaeognatha has previously been combined with the Order Thysanura or bristletails Both groups have three pronged tails with two cercus cerci and an epiproct Archaeognatha differ from Thysanura in that they are able to use their tail to spring up to centimetre cm into the air They are also the only ones to have small articulated styli on the hind Further unusual features are that the abdominal sternites are each composed of three sclerite s and they cement themselves to the substrate before ecdysis molting Like Thysanura the body is covered with scales with a thin exoskeleton that is susceptible to dehydration There are approximately species in the two families They are distributed worldwide and unusual in the insect world in that they can even be found in the Arctic where they live in leaf litter and rock crevices They feed primarily on algae but also lichen s moss es or decaying organic materials There are no species at current conservation risk though the order is one of the most poorly studied among insects and therefore it may simply be that no one has yet recognized that any species are at risk
