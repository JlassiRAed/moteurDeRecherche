A flywheel is a heavy wikt disk disk or wheel that is attached to a rotation rotating wikt shaft shaft Flywheels are used for storage of kinetic energy The momentum of the flywheel causes it to not change its rotation al speed easily Because of this flywheels help to keep the shaft rotating at the same speed This helps when the torque applied to the shaft changes often Uneven torque can change the speed of rotation Because the flywheel resists changes in speed it decreases the effects of uneven torque Engine s which use piston s to provide power usually have uneven torque and use flywheels to fix this problem It takes energy to get a wheel the fly wheel is connected to the wheels so the rotational energy is transferred to it so the bus will slow down while the fly wheel speeds up Then when the bus has to start driving again it is connected again and the energy is transferred back Of course you wouldn t want to lug a heavy wheel around on a bus so it is made of a lighter material that can withstand extremely fast rotation
