This article describes the history of the geologic time scale The principles were first laid down by Nicolaus Steno in the late th century Steno argued that rock layers are laid down in succession and that each represents a slice of time Steno formulated the superposition principle principle of superposition This says that any given stratum is probably older than those above it and younger than those below it This principle is simple but applying it to real rocks is complicated by their history During the th century geologists realized that Sequences of strata were often erosion eroded distorted tilted or even inverted after Deposition deposition Strata laid down at the same time in different areas could have entirely different appearances The strata of any given area represented only part of the Earth s long history The first serious attempts to formulate a geological time scale that could be applied anywhere on Earth took place in the late th century The most influential of those early attempts was led by Abraham Werner and others They divided the rocks of the Earth s crust remained in use as names of geological periods well into the th century Werner had the idea that all rocks had precipitated out of a single enormous flood That is called the Neptunist theory A major shift in thinking came when James Hutton read his Theory of the Earth or an Investigation of the Laws Observable in the Composition Dissolution and Restoration of Land Upon the Globe before the Royal Society of Edinburgh in March and April James Hutton in those reading became the founder of modern geology Hutton suggested the interior of the Earth was hot and that this heat was the engine which drove the creation of new rock Land was eroded by air and water and deposited as layers in the sea heat then consolidated the sediment into stone and uplifted it into new lands This theory was called Plutonist in contrast to the flood oriented theory The identification of strata by the fossils they contained was pioneered by William Smith contained the same fossils chances were good that they had been laid down at the same time Detailed studies between and of the strata and fossils of Europe produced the sequence of geological periods still used today Cuvier thought many of the geological features of the Earth could be explained by catastrophism catastrophic events which had caused the extinction of many species of animals Over the course of his career Cuvier came to believe there had not been a single catastrophe but several resulting in a succession of different fauna s Briton British geologists were most active in the th century The Cambrian epochs In general periods were named after places where the rocks were easy to see Geologists and paleontologist s based the geologic table on the relative positions of different strata and fossil s They estimated the time scales based on studying rates of various processes They estimated weathering erosion sediment ation and how long it took to turn sediment into hard rock The discovery of Radioactive decay radioactivity in and its geological applications by radiometric dating happened in the first half of the th century It made possible the absolute dating of rocks and the discovery of the age of the Earth The International Commission on Stratigraphy is working to define exactly when geologic periods start and finish and where the best examples are They are called Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point Global Boundary Stratotype Sections and Points A geologic time scale Cambridge University Press ISBN GSSP rules Table all periods
