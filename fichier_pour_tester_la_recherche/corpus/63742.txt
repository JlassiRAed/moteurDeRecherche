The Three Mile Island accident at the Three Mile Island Nuclear Power Plant in Pennsylvania was the single most important event in the fifty year history of nuclear power regulation in the United States Many people have seen the event as a turning point for the nuclear power industry in the United States The Three Mile Island power station is near Harrisburg Pennsylvania The accident began on Wednesday March and resulted in a partial core meltdown in Unit of the nuclear power plant Unit s pressurized water reactor was of MWe capacity The chain of events that led to the crisis at the TMI plant included several minor equipment failures that operator errors drastically compounded resulting in a major accident According to one reviewer of the book Reactor operators were not trained to deal with accident conditions and the NRC had not established effective communication with utilities Moreover once the accident occurred the lines of authority proved to be ill defined The public received conflicting reports that caused needless panic and evacuations It was these systemic weaknesses in the regulatory system that allowed gifted people to make the mistakes they did Large portions of the TMI reactor core melted though the fact that a partial meltdown had occurred did not become clear until The greatest source of concern during the TMI crisis was a hydrogen bubble that formed in the top of the pressure vessel which held the core Although opinions differed some reactor experts feared that over time the hydrogen bubble might become flammable or less likely explosive by combining with free oxygen in the vessel If the bubble burned or exploded it could rupture the pressure vessel and force the damaged reactor core into the containment building The loss of the vessel would not make a breach of containment inevitable but it would increase the risk of a disastrous release of radiation In the end the Three Mile Island accident though it caused a grave crisis did not produce a public health disaster In the face of a core meltdown the pressure vessel held and there was no breach of the plant s containment structure Only tiny amounts of the most dangerous forms of volatile radiation escaped to the atmosphere J Samuel Walker suggests that the TMI accident incited widespread criticism of nuclear power technology the nuclear industry and the NRC Critics faulted the industry and the NRC for their poor performance both before and after the accident The international attention garnered by the crisis redoubled the determination of and enhanced the credibility of the anti nuclear movement Arguably the United States nuclear industry has never recovered Walker reports that studies looking for long term radiation effects resulting from the accident have reached conflicting conclusions but it seems that any increase in cancer s is slight enough to have occurred by chance
