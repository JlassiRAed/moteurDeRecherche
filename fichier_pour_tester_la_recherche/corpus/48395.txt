A synapomorphy is a common character It is a term in cladistics meaning a Trait trait which is present in two or more species by common descent It is a type of homologous character or homology More precisely it is shared by two or more taxa and their most recent common ancestor whose own ancestor in turn does not possess the trait Thus it is not just an ancestral trait but a recently evolved distinguishing trait It helps to distinguish between two trees of descent which would otherwise be equally likely
