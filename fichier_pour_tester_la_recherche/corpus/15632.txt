A fire drill is a sudden practice event where people leave a building They are practicing what they would do if there was a fire in the building The event is started when a fire alarm sounder or bell keeps on sounding The entire building is evacuated and everybody leaves the building using the nearest fire exit At a school college or university the teacher or the lecturer counts the people outside to find out if anyone is missing Sometimes people are evacuated for no reason This is called a false alarm In the United Kingdom the law says that all schools must do a fire drill at the start of the academic year in September and suggests that one should occur every term Also regular health and safety checks such as testing fire alarm systems and fire extinguishers must be done weekly In the United States different states have laws that say how often schools must have fire drills For example in many states schools must have one fire drill per month Fire drills commonly take place in school s college s and public companies In public transport such as cruise ships it is called a muster drill Fire drills aren t done on airplanes but a safety demonstration that shows the emergency procedures of the aircraft is done instead If an aircraft is about to perform an emergency landing the passangers on the aircraft are told to take the safety brace position on hearing the brace command
