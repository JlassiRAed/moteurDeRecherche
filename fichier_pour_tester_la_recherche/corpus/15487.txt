 Air New Zealand Flight was a flight that operated from to The flight did not stop in Antarctica It was a sightseeing flight to Antarctica It was supposed to loop between Auckland New Zealand and Antarctica The flight s route had been changed without the crew s knowledge shortly before the plane took off Because the weather conditions of the Antarctic were so bad and the crew believed they were following the original flight plan the plane crashed straight into Mount Erebus None of the people on board the plane survived the crash The original investigation showed it was the pilot s fault but people protested and it led to an inquiry into the crash The conclusion was the accident was caused by a correction made to the route the night before the disaster and they failed to inform pilot Captain Jim Collins and co pilot Greg Cassin
