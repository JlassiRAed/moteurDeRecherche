A flare star is a variable star that becomes very much brighter unpredictably for a few minutes at a time Flares happen on flare stars in a similar way to solar flare s They are magnetic disturbances in the atmosphere of star s The brightness increases across the Electromagnetic spectrum spectrum from X ray s to radio wave s The first known flare stars were discovered in they were V Cygni and AT Microscopii Still the best known flare star is UV Ceti that star was discovered in Today similar flare stars are classified as UV Ceti type variable star s in variable star catalogs Flares can happen once every few days or as in the case of Barnard s Star much less frequently Proxima Centauri the nearest star to the Solar System is also a flare star Most flare stars are dim red dwarf s although research done not too long ago suggests that less massive are also known to flare but scientists understand that a companion star in a binary system causes these flares This companion star disturbs the magnetic field Nine stars similar to the Sun have also been seen to flare
