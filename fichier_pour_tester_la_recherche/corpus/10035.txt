 Power system harmonics are the harmonic contents from the utility frequency Harmonics are one kind of wikt distortion distortion to a voltage or Electric current current s waveform This distortion is produced by Nonlinear system non linear devices connected to the power system Since equipment is made to work at the utility frequency harmonics can make it work wrong This one kind of power quality problem It increases heat ing in power equipment Harmonics can be eliminated or reduced by using Filter harmonic filter
