In vascular plant s phloem is the living Tissue for bark Aphid s and other insect s feed on the phloem by inserting a fine tube into the plant penetrating the tiny phloem cells deep within the plant The high pressure in the phloem tubes forces the phloem sap into the insect Most of the sugar passes right through the insect so that nearby surfaces get sticky and often become black due to the growth of fungus Water which is absorbed by the plant s roots travels up the stem to the leaf through the xylem This means that the xylem helps during photosynthesis by bringing water up the plant
