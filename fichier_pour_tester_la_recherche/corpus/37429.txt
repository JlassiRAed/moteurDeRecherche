In cryptography confusion and diffusion are two properties of the operation of a secure cipher Confusion and diffusion were identified by Claude Elwood Shannon Claude Shannon in his paper Communication Theory of Secrecy Systems published in In Shannon s original definitions Confusion refers to making the relationship between the key key and the ciphertext as complex and as involved as possible Diffusion refers to the property that redundancy in the statistics of the plaintext is Dissipation dissipated in the statistics of the ciphertext Diffusion is associated with the dependency of the output bits on the input bits In a cipher with good diffusion flipping an input bit should change each output bit with a probability of one half Substitution cipher Substitution to achieve both confusion and diffusion respectively
