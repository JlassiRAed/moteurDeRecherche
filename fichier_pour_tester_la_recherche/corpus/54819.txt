In mathematics de Moivre s formula named after Abraham de Moivre states that for any complex number z and integer n where is the complex number Other forms of describing complex numbers argument of z The formula is very important because it connects complex numbers and trigonometry It can be easily proved using the trigonometry form of complex numbers Mathematical induction induction and some trigonometrical identity identities Furthermore using this formula any equation of where w is complex can be solved Math stub
