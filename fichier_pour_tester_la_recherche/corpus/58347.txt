An exoskeleton supports and protects an animal s body from outside and not like the internal endoskeleton of for example human beings from inside Many invertebrate animals Exoskeletons contain rigid and resistant components that fulfil a set of functional roles including protection excretion sensing support feeding and acting as a barrier against desiccation Exoskeletons first appeared in the fossil record about million years ago and their evolution has been seen as critical as a driving role in the Cambrian explosion of animals that took place subsequent to this time
