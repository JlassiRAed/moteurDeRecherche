A chemical reaction happens when one or more chemical s are changed into one or more other chemicals Examples Some reactions are fast and others are slow Some happen at different speeds depending on temperature or other things For example wood does not react with air when it is cold but if it is made hot enough it will start to burn Some reactions give out energy These are exothermic reaction s In other reactions energy is taken in These are endothermic reaction s Nuclear reaction s are not chemical reactions Chemical reactions involve only the electrons of atoms nuclear reactions involve the protons and neutrons in the atomic nucleus atomic nuclei
