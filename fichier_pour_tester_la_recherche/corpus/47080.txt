 Population sans doubles comptes is a phrase in French that means population without double counting in English In France because of the census the INSEE has allowed people who live in one place and study in a different place to be counted twice so as to show how the population moves Because of this each commune in France has many numbers of how many people live in it For example students may be counted where they study and where they live but do not study It is just like allowing students in the United States to vote in the town election of the place they are studying in and the town election where they were born
