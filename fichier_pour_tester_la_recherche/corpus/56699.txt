 Archostemata is the smallest suborder of beetle s There are less than fifty known species Archostemata is an ancient lineage with a number of basal primitive characteristics They are similar to the first beetles which appear in the fossil record about million years ago The suborder contains the only Neoteny paedogenic beetles Micromalthus debilis These beetles are rare Fossil deposits from the Permian suggest that Archostemata were once much more common and were widespread over the globe The species which remain are just scattered vestiges of their former population Abundant cladistic and fossil evidence shows the Archostematans are the basal suborder of true beetles
