A great circle the largest possible circle that can be drawn on a sphere one that divides the surface into equal halves called hemisphere s It is a circle that has the same diameter as the sphere it was drawn on These curves are geodesic s in the sphere and all have the same circumference that is the length of the circle There are an infinite number of great circles that can be drawn on any perfect sphere The longitude lines on a globe all form great circles that pass through the same two points The Equator is another great circle Great Circles can be used to determine the shortest surface distance between two points on a sphere A straight line from plane Euclidean geometry corresponds to a Great Circle in non Euclidean spherical geometry
