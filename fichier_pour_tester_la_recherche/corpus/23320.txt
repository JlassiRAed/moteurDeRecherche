 Apatosaurus is a sauropod dinosaur which lived in the Upper Jurassic period It is in the same family as Diplodocus Brontosaurus was once thought a later name for Apatosaurus but is now proved to be a separate genus Apatosaurus grew as big as meters long meters tall at the hip and weighed up to metric tons It ate plants Its bones have been found in Wyoming Colorado Oklahoma and Utah When it was first found scientists thought that Apatosaurus lived partly under water since it could not hold its own weight on dry land Now they think it lived on dry land probably in herd s The cervical vertebrae were less elongated and more solid than those of Diplodocus The bones of the leg were much stockier implying a more robust animal The tail was held above the ground during normal locomotion Like most sauropods Apatosaurus had only a single large claw on each forelimb with the first three toes on the hind limb possessing claws There are at least two species of Apatosaurus
