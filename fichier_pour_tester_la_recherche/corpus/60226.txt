 Square foot gardening is a type of gardening made popular by Mel Bartholemew It is based on the idea that the wide rows in traditional gardening is a waste of time Labour squares of about one square foot Common spacing is one plant per square for larger plants such as broccoli and basil four per square for medium large plants like lettuce nine per square for medium small plants like spinach and sixteen per square for small plants such as onions and carrots The weed s are removed from the beds and the plants are watered from the pathways This stops the soil from being compacted
