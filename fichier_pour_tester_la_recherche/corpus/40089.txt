In cryptography a key is a piece of information that allows control over the encryption or decryption process There are two basic types of cryptographic algorithm s Symmetric key algorithm Symmetric algorithm If there is just one key for encrypting and decrypting the algorithm is called symmetric Public key cryptography Asymmetric algorithm If there are two different keys each of which can be used only to encrypt data or only to decrypt it the algorithm is called asymmetric If an algorithm is asymmetric one person publishing publishes a key and accepts messages encrypted with that key Anyone can encrypt a message but only the person who owns the other key can decrypt it This is how online stores banks etc work
