A digital signature or digital signature scheme is a type of Public key cryptography asymmetric cryptography For messages sent through an insecure channel a good implementation of digital signature algorithm is the one that makes the receiver believe that the message was sent by the claimed sender and trust the message Digital signatures are equivalent to traditional handwritten signature s in many respects properly implemented digital signatures are more difficult to copy than the handwritten type Digital signature are implemented using cryptography Digital signatures can also provide acknowledgement meaning that the signer cannot successfully claim they did not sign a message while also claiming their private key remains secret Digital signatures are often used to implement electronic signature s a broader term that refers to any electronic data that holds a meaning of a signature In some countries including the United States and in the European Union electronic signatures may have legal significance
