 Microcode is the name for a number of instruction instruction s or data structure s which are involved in implementing higher level machine language in many processor s especially microprogrammed ones Microcode is on memory that is very fast to access When a machine level instruction needs to be executed microcode tells the processor what electronic circuits should be used When a new processor is designed an engineer also writes the microcode for the instructions of machine language This is called Microprogramming the resulting code is called a microprogram In early processors each instruction was hard wired This has several drawbacks the most obvious is that correcting an error in processor design means that the processor needs to be replaced
