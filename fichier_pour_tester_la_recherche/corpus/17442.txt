 Tagged Command Queueing used by Serial ATA SATA drives SCSI TCQ does not suffer from the same limitations as ATA TCQ Before TCQ an operating system was only able to send one request at a time In order to boost performance it had to decide the order of the requests based on its own possibly incorrect idea of what the hard drive was doing With TCQ the drive can make its own decisions about how to order the requests The result is that TCQ can improve the overall performance of a hard drive if it is implemented correctly
