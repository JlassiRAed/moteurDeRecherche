 Listening is not quite the same thing as hearing Hearing is a biological process that can be scientifically explained but listening is a psychological process of what happens to sounds as we interpret and use them It is a cognitive psychology cognitive activity In psychology speech is part of pragmatics a field which deals with sign s and their interpretation The signs in question are called speech acts To listen means to try and understand what has been said Listening is often one side of a conversation Asking questions helps one understand what has been said A subject can be better understood by asking the correct questions Listening differs from wikt obedience obeying Parents often say to a disobedient child that he didn t listen to me meaning he heard but didn t do as was suggested Listening also applies to sound s not just language It is wikt active active hearing We hear a sound and know what it means This applies to animals as well Cats list in the long grass for the little sounds that mice make So perhaps a better description of listening is deliberate hearing to get the meaning of sounds
