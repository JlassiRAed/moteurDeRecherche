 Compressive stress is the stress stress on material s that leads to a smaller volume By compressive stress the material is under Physical compression compression Compressive stress to wikt bar bars column s etc leads to shortening One can increase the compressive stress until compressive strength is reached Then materials will react with wikt ductile ductile behaviour For example if a cylinder is compressed under the action of the applied force the restoring force per unit area is known as the compressive stress It is one of the best stresses for chassis so if you have a chassis report explain it well as it helps a lot
