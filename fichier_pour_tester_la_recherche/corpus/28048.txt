 Aircraft carriers are warship s that carry airplane s and other aircraft like helicopter s They are used by navy navies to allow fixed wing aircraft aircraft to fight along with naval warships Aircraft carriers are usually very large carrying hundreds or thousands of sailor s and tens or hundreds of aircraft The top of an aircraft carrier is called the flight deck and looks like a very small airport Old aircraft carriers carried airplanes that could takeoff and land in the short distance of the flight deck without help Similarly small modern aircraft carriers only carry helicopters or specially designed airplanes such as the Harrier Jump Jet that can take off and land straight up and down or in the short distance of the flight deck The flight deck of a large modern aircraft carrier has a landing area and a take off area The landing area is in the back and has a short runway Airplanes stop by using a hook on the back of the airplane to grab wires stretched across the runway In the front the flight deck has a steam powered catapult that connects to the front wheel of an airplane The catapult throws the airplane off the deck helping it take off quickly So aircraft carriers are basically floating mobile airports Because they are so big modern aircraft carriers often have on board nuclear power plant s Other aircraft carriers are powered by diesel engines Except for their airplanes aircraft carriers usually have few weapons so other warships escort them Together the aircraft carrier and these warships form a carrier group
