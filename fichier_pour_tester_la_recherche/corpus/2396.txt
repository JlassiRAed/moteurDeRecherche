The surface gravity g of an astronomy astronomical or other object is the gravity gravitational acceleration wikt experience experience d at its surface The surface gravity may be thought of as the acceleration caused by the gravity experienced by a hypothetical test particle which is very close to the object s surface and which in order not to disturb the system has negligible mass Surface gravity is measured in units of acceleration which in the SI system are meters per second squared It may also be described as a multiple of the Earth s gravity g m s cite web
