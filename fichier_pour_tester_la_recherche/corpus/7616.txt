An inverter is an Electronic component electric apparatus that changes direct current into alternating current Direct current is created by devices such as Battery batteries and solar panel s When connected an inverter allows these devices to provide electric power for small household devices The inverter does this through a complex process of electrical adjustment From this process AC electric power is produced This form of electricity can be used to power an Lightbulb electric light a microwave oven or some other electric machine An inverter usually also increases the voltage In order to increase the voltage the current must be decreased so an inverter will use a lot of current on the DC side when only a small amount is being used on the AC side Inverters are made in many different sizes They can be as small as watt s or as large as megawatt
