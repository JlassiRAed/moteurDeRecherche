 Stress analysis is the study of Stress strains in materials and structures as force is applied against them It is a topic in engineering Stress may cause deformation or Material fracture fractures in materials Stress analysis is about finding out how much stress causes deformation in a given material Stress analysis is an important task for civil engineering civil mechanical engineering mechanical and aerospace engineering aerospace engineers They work on the design of structures of all sizes such as bridge s and dam s machine s and even plastic cutlery and Staple staples Stress analysis is also used in the maintenance of such structures and to investigate the causes of structural failures physics stub
