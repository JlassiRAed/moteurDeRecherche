 Acomys Deomys Lophuromys Uranomys The subfamily Deomyinae consists of four genera of mouse like rodent s These were placed in the subfamilies Murinae and Dendromurinae until very recently They are sometimes called Acomyinae particularly in references that predate the discovery that the link rat Deomys ferugineus is part of the clade Deomyinae is the older and more appropriate name Deomyines share no morphology molar have been suggested though This subfamily is united solely on the basis of shared genetics genetic mutations These conclusions have demonstrated good statistics statistical support using nuclear and mitochondrial DNA mitochondrial DNA as well as DNA DNA hybridization Because of the lack of physical characteristics that supportthis group it is very possible that the subfamily as it is currently recognized could grow bigger Many of the genus genera currently placed in Murinae or Dendromurinae have never been included in a molecular phylogeny molecular phylogenetic analysis There are potential surprises awaiting when they are All genera are found in Africa suggesting the deomyines may have originated there The spiny mice Acomys spp are also found in Asia There are currently genera and species included in the Deomyinae
