The McLafferty rearrangement is an organic reaction seen in mass spectrometry A mass spectrometer breaks apart the molecule being studied The molecule breaks apart in consistent ways that chemists can predict Most times a carbon carbon bond breaks and the atoms do not jump across the break between the fragments The McLafferty rearrangement is an example of a hydrogen atom jumping to the other fragment as a part of the process of the bond breaking It happens in an organic molecule containing a keto group
