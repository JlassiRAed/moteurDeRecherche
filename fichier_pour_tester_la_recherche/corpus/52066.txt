 Electricity is the presence and flow of electric charge Its best known form is the flow of electrons through conductors such as copper wires Electricity is a form of energy that comes in positive and negative forms that occur naturally It is a form of energy which we use to power machine s and Electronics electrical devices When the charges are not moving electricity is called static electricity When the charges are moving they are an electric current sometimes called dynamic electricity Lightning is the most known and dangerous kind of electricity in nature but sometimes static electricity causes things to stick together Electricity can be dangerous especially around water Static electricity occurs when there are fewer or more electrons for the atoms If the electrons stay where they are the atom that has too many or too few electrons will attract or sometimes repel other atoms If the electrons move from where there are too many to where there are too few an electric current will flow Since the nineteenth century electricity has been used in every part of our lives Until then it was just a curiosity seen in a thunderstorm We can make electricity if we pass a magnet close to a metal wire This is a generator which is the main way The biggest generators are in power station s We can put the right chemicals in a jar with two different kinds of metal rods This is a battery often used for portable machines We can also make static electricity by rubbing two things for instance a wool cap and a plastic ruler together This may make a spark Some of our electricity comes from photovoltaic cells Electricity arrives at homes through wire s from the places where it is made It is used by electric lamp s electric heating heater s etc Many appliance s such as washing machine s and electric cookers use electricity In factories electricity powers machine s People who deal with electricity and electrical devices in our homes and factories are called electrician s
