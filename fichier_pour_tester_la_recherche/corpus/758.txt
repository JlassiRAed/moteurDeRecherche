A black powder rocket motor pushes a model rocket using black powder Black powder in the rockets is made of charcoal sulphur and potassium nitrate The amount of each part can be changed to change how fast the black powder burns The black powder burns very fast The hot gases move fast as they leave the back of the rocket This pushes the rocket forward Black powder rocket motors were made in a simple form by the Chinese They were first written about in the early th century The rocket motors have gotten better over the years They have several uses Some can be used as weapons Some have cameras to take pictures from a height to get information Some are also used just for fun Black powder rocket motors are only made in small sizes If they are bigger there is a bigger chance of exploding They also do not perform as well if they are bigger They are made in different sizes called classes The classes are A through E If the motor needs to be bigger than this a different type of fuel is used This is called a composite fuel Some examples of composite fuels are ammonium perchlorate or ammonium nitrate
