 Electric power distribution is the delivery system of electricity to places that use it such as home s and other building s It is done mainly by power line s transformer s Electrical substation substations and Electricity meter meters The electricity comes from the power station at high voltage and is delivered at medium to low voltage levels In early days electricity was distributed as direct current was later introduced during the War of Currents DC distribution disappeared because transformer s can easily convert AC to high voltage for electric power transmission and low voltage to use at home
