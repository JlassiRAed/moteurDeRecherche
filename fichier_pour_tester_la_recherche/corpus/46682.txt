 Animal s with nervous system s are born with instincts An instinct is a part of the behaviour of an organism It is heredity inherited not learned However the term does not include the operation of sense organ s and does not include the normal working of the autonomic nervous system Instincts are to do with visible muscular action in response to releaser s Releasers are triggers which set off chains of instinctive behaviour Although instincts are not learned in some cases their performance can be improved by experience and practice There are some problems with the term instinct It can be used loosely to mean a general tendency such as a man s instinct is to protect his family It can be used to describe chains of behaviour of mixed origin Properly it is used only of well defined acts whose causation is inherited and which are triggered by specific stimulus stimuli called releasers Other terms for instinct are fixed action patterns and innate behaviour chains
