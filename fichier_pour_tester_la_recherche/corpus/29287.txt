 Petrolacosaurus was a small long animal the earliest diapsid known It lived during the later Carboniferous period The strata where it was found in Kansas are of Pennsylvanian age approximately million years old Its diet was probably small insect s Petrolacosaurus had distinctive canine like secondary sized teeth a Trait trait found mainly in therapsids and later in mammals Its fossils were found in Kansas USA Petrolacosaurus was too derived to be the ancestor of all modern forms In fact it was already a diapsid with two openings on each side of its skull to add attachment points for jaw muscles Hence it cannot have been the ancestor of any synapsids which have only one such opening Synapsids diverged from the common amniote tree before the diapsids did BBC Television in Walking with Dinosaurs made the mistake of talking about it as an ancestor of both reptiles and mammals
