 Cornus canadensis is a herbaceous member of the Cornaceae family It has various common names such as the Bunchberry dogwood Canadian Bunchberry Quatre temps or Crackerberry It is a widespread plant of the northern hemisphere It grows about ndash cm tall and bears tiny flower s a few millimetres across They form an inflorescence at the center of four white petal like bract s ndash cm diameter Each flower has highly elastic petal s that flip backward releasing springy filaments that are cocked underneath the petals The filaments snap upward flinging pollen out in less than half a millisecond The pollen experiences a force two to three thousand times the force of gravity One of the fastest actions in the plant world is the explosive opening of flowers on the bunchberry dogwood which happens in just under milliseconds As the flowers burst open the petals quickly separate and flip back exposing the stamens During the first milliseconds researchers have calculated the stamens are exposed to a force times greater than astronauts experience during blast off The mechanism it is understood allows pollen to be thrown upwards in order for it to be transported by the wind BBC News Environment Picture Gallery In other words it is a mechanism for cross pollination by air The fruits are edible with a mild flavour somewhat like apples The large seeds within are somewhat hard and crunchy Birds are the main dispersal agents of the seeds consuming the fruit during their fall migration In Alaska bunchberry is an important forage plant for mule deer black tailed deer and moose which consume it throughout the growing season Where bunchberry a forest species and Cornus suecica a bog species grow near each other in their overlapping ranges in Alaska Labrador and Greenland they can Hybrid ize by pollination cross pollination producing plants with intermediate characteristics
