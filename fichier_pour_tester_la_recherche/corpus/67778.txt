 Anti tank dogs were dog s with explosive material explosives placed on their back s These dogs were training trained to run under enemy tank s The explosives were then remotely detonated in order to destroy the target tank These dogs were trained by the Soviet Union during World War II to be used against Germany German armored vehicles They were trained on Russian tanks which used diesel fuel In battle the dogs often ran toward the smell of diesel fuel from the Soviet tanks instead of the intended German targets The German Army soon learned about the dogs so all Russian dogs were shot on sight by the Germans Very few dogs remained in the Eastern Front Eastern Front as a result of this After the war better weapons against tanks were made Therefore it is unlikely that anti tank dogs will ever be used again
