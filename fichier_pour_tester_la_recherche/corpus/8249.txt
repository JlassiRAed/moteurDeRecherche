 Hox genes are a group of related gene s that determine the basic structure and orientation of animals Hox is short for homeobox Hox genes are critical for the proper placement of Segmentation segment structures of animals during early embryo nic development Hox genes are a complex of gene s whose protein s bind to the regulatory regions of target genes The target genes then activate or repress cell processes to direct the final development of the organism Hox genes have a DNA sequence known as the homeobox The homeobox is a nucleotide long DNA sequence which codes for a amino acid long protein domain known as the homeodomain This works by binding with DNA Hox genes are in gene clusters on the genome The order of the Locus loci in the chromosome parallels the order in which the loci are expressed in segment s along the body This cluster of master control genes programs the development of all higher organisms The cluster is highly conserved It has not changed much over hundreds of millions of years of evolutionary history sequence analysis Molecular evidence shows that some limited number of Hox genes have existed in the Cnidaria since before the earliest true Bilateria Bilatera This means the system evolved before the Palaeozoic era Ryan J F et al Pre bilaterian origins of the Hox cluster and the Hox code evidence from the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis PLoS ONE e
