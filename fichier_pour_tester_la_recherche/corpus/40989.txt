 Electronic filters are electrical circuit s which perform signal processing functions specifically to remove unwanted frequency components from the signal to enhance wanted ones or both Electronic filters can be passive component passive or active filter active analog circuit analog or digital filter digital high pass filter high pass low pass filter low pass band pass filter bandpass band stop filter band reject or all pass filter all pass discrete time or Continuous signal continuous time linear filter linear or non linear filter non linear infinite impulse response The most common types of electronic filters are linear filters regardless of other aspects of their design Digital filters use a Fourier transform tech stub
