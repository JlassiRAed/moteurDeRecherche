The Trans Asian Railway The project was started in the s The idea then was to have miles of rail link between Singapore and Istanbul Turkey Further connections to Europe and Africa were also considered At that time there was not as much shipping and air travel as today and the project promised to make shipping times faster and lower costs between Europe and Asia Progress in developing the TAR was slowed by political and economic problems during the s s and early s By the s the end of the Cold war and normal relations between some countries made it seem more possible to create a rail network across the Asian continent The TAR was seen as a way to handle the huge increases in international trade between Eurasian nations It was also supposed to make more movement of goods between countries easier It was seen as a way to improve the economies of landlocked countries like Laos Afghanistan Mongolia and the Central Asian republics and make them easier to reach Much of the railway network already exists but there are still some major gaps A big challenge is the differences in rail gauge across Eurasia There are four different major rail gauges across the continent most of Europe as well as Turkey Iran China and the Korea s use the mm gauge known as Standard gauge Finland Russia and the former Soviet republics use a mm gauge most of the railways in India Pakistan Bangladesh and Sri Lanka use a mm gauge and most of Southeast Asia has metre gauge For the most part the TAR would not change national gauges large machines would be built to move shipping containers from train to train at the breaks of gauge By the four corridors had been studied as part of the plan
