 Saul is a King in the Books of Samuel Books of ChroniclesIn the Bible Saul loves and obeys God until he stops listening to God and becomes slightly greedy losing God s whole interest for him Samuel the prophet comes and gives him a warning that God is not with him anymore When turning to leave Saul grabs Samuel s robe and it tears Samuel says The Lord has torn the kingdom of Israel from you today and has given it to one of your neighbors to one better than you He who is the Glory of Israel does not lie or change his mind for he is not a man that he should change his mind Then the spirit of the Lord departs from Saul and an evil spirit torments him Saul takes David the shepherd and the youngest son of Jesse into his service to play a harp for him and so that he would be soothed when the evil spirit rests upon him Later he gets jealous of David and begins to suspect David as the one of your neighbors that Samuel had mentioned He grows afraid of David and finally his jealousy turns to hatred and he wishes to kill him But Saul s son Jonathan is bound to David in friendship which makes his anger fume on Jonathan as well Later Saul dies at the battle against the Philistines and falls on his own sword because he does not want to be abused by the uncircumcised Philistines
