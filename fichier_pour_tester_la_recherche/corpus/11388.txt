A helicopter lift s up off of the ground and moves because of its helicopter rotor rotor s A rotor is several small wings called rotor blades that spin together around a shaft For that reason helicopters are sometimes called rotary wing aircraft A helicopter flies differently from an airplane An airplane must move forward to stay in the air but because the helicopter s rotor blades are always moving the helicopter can stop and stay in one place above the ground This allows them to land in places where an airplane cannot Helicopters can move by tilting their rotor blades which causes the aircraft to fly in the direction the blades are tilted
