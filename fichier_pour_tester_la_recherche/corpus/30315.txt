 Cogeneration is the use of a heat engine or a power station to make both electricity and useful heat at the same time Conventional power plants emit the heat created as a byproduct of electricity generation into the environment through cooling tower s as flue gas or by other means Combined heat and power captures the byproduct heat for domestic or industrial heating purposes either very close to the plant or especially in Scandinavia and eastern Europe for distribution through pipes to district heating heat local housing Byproduct heat at moderate temperatures can also be used in Gas absorption refrigerator absorption chillers for cooling A plant producing electricity heat and cold is sometimes called regeneration or more generally polygene ration plant Cogeneration is a thermodynamics thermodynamically efficiency efficient use of fuel In separate production of electricity some energy is lost as waste heat but in cogeneration this energy performs useful work
