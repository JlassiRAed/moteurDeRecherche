The Fundamental theorem of arithmetic The theorem also says that there is only one way to write the number If two people found two different ways to write the number the only thing that can be different is the order in which the primes are written For example we can write and if somebody else finds another way to write or as product of prime numbers we can put those prime numbers in the right order and find out that it is the same as what we have here Finding the prime numbers is called factorization This theorem can be used in cryptography
