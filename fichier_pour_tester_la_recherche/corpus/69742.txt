In telecommunications cleartext is the form of a message or data which is in a form that is immediately understandable to a human being without additional processing In particular it implies that this message is sent or stored without cryptography cryptographic protection The phrase s in clear en clair and in the clear are the same It is close to but not entirely the same as the term plaintext Formally plaintext is information that is fed as an input to a coding process while ciphertext is what comes out of that process Plaintext might be compressed coded or otherwise changed before it is converted to ciphertext so it is quite common to find plaintext that is not cleartext Websites using insecure HTTP send using cleartext with all data supplied may read the password username and anything else sent to the website
