 Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Hemoglobin Oxyhemoglobin does not When an area of the brain is active the blood flow to that area increases and more oxyhemoglobin is delivered to supply the active cells with oxygen This means less of the signal is absorbed An active area of the brain absorbs and emits less energy than a less active area This can be seen live as it is happening when different areas of the brain light up on the images as they become less active
