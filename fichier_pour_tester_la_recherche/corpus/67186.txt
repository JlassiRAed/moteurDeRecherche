 Part of Wikipedia What Wikipedia is not What Wikipedia is not Wikipedia is not a soapbox a battleground or a vehicle for propaganda and advertising Therefore Wikipedia articles are not Propaganda or advocacy of any kind Of course an article can report objectively about such things as long as an attempt is made to approach a Wikipedia neutral point of view Self promotion It can be tempting to write about yourself or projects you have a strong personal involvement in However do remember that the standards for encyclopedic articles apply to such pages just like any other including the requirement to maintain a neutral point of view which is difficult when writing about yourself Creating overly abundant links and references to autobiographical articles is unacceptable Advertising Articles about companies and products are acceptable if they are written in an Wikipedia Neutral point of view
