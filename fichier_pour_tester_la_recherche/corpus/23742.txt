 Vasopressin is the hormone which controls the production of urine in the bladder It is secreted by the pituitary gland based on the salt concentration of the blood It is negative feedback the more concentrated the salt in the blood is the more vasopressin is secreted which in turn makes the kidney tubules more permeable allowing more water to be reabsorbed into the blood and creating less but more concentrated urine It also triggers feelings of thirst
