 Horizontal gene transfer is any process in which an organism gets genetic material from another organism without being the Reproduction offspring of that organism By contrast vertical transfer occurs when an organism gets genetic material from its ancestor e g its parent or a species from which it has evolved Most thinking in genetics has focused on vertical transfer but there is a growing awareness that horizontal gene transfer is a significant phenomenon Yap W H et al Distinct types of rRNA operons exist in the genome of the actinomycete Thermomonspora chromogena and evidence for horizontal gene transfer of an entire rRNA operon J Bacteriol Amongst single celled organisms it may be the dominant form of genetic transfer Artificial horizontal gene transfer is a form of genetic engineering
