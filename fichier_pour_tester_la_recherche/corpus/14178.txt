 Arsenate is an ion Its chemical formula is AsO It has arsenic in its oxidation state Arsenates are salt s of arsenic acid They are oxidizing agent s Sometimes not all of the deprotonation protons are taken away from the arsenic acid and then hydrogen arsenate salts are formed Their chemical formulas are HAsO Arsenate can replace phosphate in the cells but it does not work like a phosphate does The cell dies and that is why arsenates are toxic Some bacteria can use arsenate instead of phosphate though They are called arsenic bacteria
