 Anfinsen s dogma is a hypothesis in molecular biology suggested by Christian Anfinsen The idea is that a protein folding into its protein structure native structure is done automatically by the protein s amino acid sequence It is only true for some proteins For other proteins Chaperone chaperones are needed Anfinsen shared the Nobel Prize for Chemistry for his work on the structure of the enzyme ribonuclease A the native structure is a unique and stable state There are three conditions uniqueness requires that the sequence does not have any other configuration with a comparable Gibbs free energy free energy stability small changes in the surrounding environment cannot give rise to changes in the minimum configuration kinetical accessibility means the final shape can be got without going through any highly complex changes in the shape How the protein reaches this structure is the subject of the field of protein folding which has a related dogma called Levinthal s paradox The Levinthal paradox states that the number of possible conformations available to a given protein is astronomically large such that even a small protein of residues would require more time than the universe has existed to explore all possible conformations and choose the appropriate one Prions are an exception to Anfinsen s dogma Prions are stable conformations of proteins which differ from the native folding state In Bovine spongiform encephalopathy native proteins re fold into a different stable conformation which causes fatal amyloid buildup Other amyloid diseases including Alzheimer s disease and Parkinson s disease are also exceptions to Anfinsen s dogma
