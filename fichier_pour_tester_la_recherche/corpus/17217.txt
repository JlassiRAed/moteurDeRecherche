 Computational chemistry is a wikt branch branch of chemistry that uses computer science to help solve chemical problems These programs calculate the structures and properties of molecule s and solid s Computational chemistry normally wikt complement complements the information obtained by chemical experiment s It can wikt predict predict chemical phenomena that have not yet been wikt observed observed It is widely used in the design of new drug s and material s Computational chemistry can wikt predict predict structure cross sections for scattering theory collision with other particle s Computational chemistry looks at both static and dynamic systems In all cases as the size of the system being studied grows the computer time and other resources used also grows That system can be a single molecule a group of molecules or a solid Computational chemistry methods range from highly accurate to very approximate Highly accurate methods are typically feasible only for small systems
