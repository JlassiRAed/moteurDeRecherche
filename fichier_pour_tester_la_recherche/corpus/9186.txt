A thermosetting plastic also known as a thermoset is polymer material that irreversibly Curing cures The curing may be done by a chemical reaction ir radiation such as electron beam processingThermoset materials are usually liquid or malleable before curing so they can be Molding molded into their final form Others are used as adhesive s Others are solids Some solid thermosetting polymers are used as molding compound in semiconductors and integrated circuits Once hardened a thermoset resin cannot be reheated and melted back to a liquid form
