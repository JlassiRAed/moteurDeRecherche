A henge is a Neolithic earthwork It has a ring bank and ditch with the ditch inside the bank They are not thought to be defensive For defence it would be much better to have the ditch outside the bank so attackers would need to climb up further Henges are typical of the British Isles but there are a few similar structures in continental Europe Henges are divided into three types Henge There is typically little evidence of occupation in a henge although they may contain ritual structures such as stone circle s timber circles and standing stone s Examples of henges are at Avebury in Wiltshire which contains the largest stone circle in Britain The Great Circle at Stanton Drew in Somerset which contains the second largest stone circle in Britain The Ring of Brodgar in Orkney which contains the third largest stone circle in Britain Notes example of henges without other significant internal monuments are the three henges of Thornborough Henges in Yorkshire Stonehenge is not a typical henge because the ditch is outside the main earthwork bank Mini henge Like an ordinary henge except the central flat area is less than m in diameter An example is the Neolithic site at Dorchester on Thames Henge enclosure but lack evidence of domestic occupation Examples of henge enclosures are Durrington Walls in Wiltshire and Mount Pleasant Henge in Dorset Malone Caroline Neolithic Britain and Ireland Tempus Stroud Gloucestershire
