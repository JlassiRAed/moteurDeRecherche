A bog is a wetland where peat builds up Peat is layers of dead plant material mdash often moss es in most cases Sphagnum moss It is one of the four main types of wetlands Other names for bogs include mire quagmire and muskeg Frequently as the illustration on the right shows they are covered in Ericaceae Ericaceous shrubs rooted in the Sphagnum moss and peat The gradual buildup of decayed plant material in a bog forms a carbon sink Bogs occur where the water at the ground surface is acid ic and low in nutrients In some cases the water is got entirely from precipitation Water flowing out of bogs has a characteristic brown colour which comes from dissolved peat tannin s In general the low fertility and cool climate results in relatively slow plant growth but decay is even slower because of the saturated soil So the amount of peat increases Large areas of landscape can be covered many meters deep in peat Bogs have a distinctive group of plant and animal species and are of high importance for biodiversity particularly in landscapes that are otherwise settled and farmed
