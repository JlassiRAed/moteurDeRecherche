A carbene is a molecule with a carbon atom that has two chemical bond bonds and two other electron s that do not make any bonds Since the carbon has only electrons around it it is quite reactive The general formula can be written as R R A carbene can be a singlet or a triplet In the first case the two electrons that do not make bonds are like a lone pair They both stay in the same atomic orbital orbital In a triplet carbene instead the two electron stay in different orbitals Here they both have the same spin spin Carbenes can do many reactions They can be both electrophile s and nucleophile s They like doing addition reaction s on double bond s They are also found in cheletropic reaction s Most carbenes are very unstable However some can exist for a long time A famous example is Grubbs catalyst which was developed by Robert Grubbs
