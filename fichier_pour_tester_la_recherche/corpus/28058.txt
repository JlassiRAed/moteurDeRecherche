 The order Triops and Lepidura The two genera are considered living fossil s as they have not changed in outward form since the Triassic Notostracans or tadpole shrimps are omnivore s living on the bottom of temporary pools and shallow lakes They live in pools of water on every continent except Antarctica They grow very quickly and can reach adulthood in a week Triops only live for a short time a record breaking female only lived to be days When their pools dry up adult tadpole shrimp die Their Egg eggs however stop developing for a time When they are in water again they come to life and new Triops are hatched This is because of a state known as diapause where eggs can lie dormant for up to twenty years before hatching again
