Signed Number representations are used to solve the problem of representing negative integers in binary The problem of trying to store the Negative number negative sign of a binary number is that there are no states left to use with which to represent the negative assignment It is not possible to just use off for minus and on for plus because the computer would have no way of knowing whether it was a digit or a sign To overcome this issue computer designers invented two methods for storing negative binary numbers Sign and magnitude sign and magnitude and s complement s complement These produce alternative representations for signed numbers
