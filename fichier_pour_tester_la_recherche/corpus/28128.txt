 Tree frogs are frog s that spend most of their life in tree s There are several Lineage lines of Neobatrachia which have evolved into tree frogs These groups are only distantly related but they have evolved for a long time in similar conditions The result is that today there are species from different groups that look very much like each other This is convergent evolution It goes so far that in almost all cases where one group occurs the other does not Their current distribution shows that the last common ancestor of both groups lived before the dinosaur s K T extinction event disappeared They do not normally descend to the ground except to mate and spawn though some build foam nests on leaves and rarely leave the trees at all as adults In some species the eggs develop directly into adults in others the tadpole stage is spent in the water pool of a large tropical tree leaf Many tree frogs can change their colour for better camouflage Others are poisonous and display warning colouration Tree frogs are usually tiny as their weight has to be carried by the branches and twigs of their habitat While some reach cm vice like grip
