In physics the field strength of a field force exerted by the field on a given object is proportionality proportional to the field strength In differential geometry the field strength is another name for the curvature form For the electromagnetic field the curvature form is an antisymmetric matrix whose elements are the electric field and magnetic field the electromagnetic tensor In radio engineering field strength is the strength of radio waves in a particular location
