The Great Wall is one of the largest known super structure s in the Universe It is a huge group of galaxy galaxies about million light year s away The Great Wall is like a long filament it is over million light years long million light years wide but only million light years thick It was discovered in by Margaret Geller and John Huchra from redshift survey data Cite journal We do not know how much farther the wall extends Our view is blocked by the galactic plane of the Milky Way The Interstellar medium gas and dust from the Milky Way obscures the view of astronomers This makes it impossible to find out if the wall ends or continues on further In the standard model of the evolution of the universe such structures as the Great Wall form along and follow web like strings of dark matter Cite book and it is this normal matter that astronomers see forming long thin walls of super galactic clusters
