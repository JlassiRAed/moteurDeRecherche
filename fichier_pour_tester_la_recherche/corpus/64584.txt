 Center of mass or barycenter of a system is the average position of all the mass in a system In a rigid body the centre of mass is always in the same place In a loose collection the center of mass may be in space as it is in the Solar System Also as planets orbit s change slightly so will the position of the barycenter A simple way to understand the concept of barycenter is to push a supermarket trolley If you hold only one corner and push it will only go in a straight line when you push through the centre of mass Otherwise a turning force is created This shows that the mass acts as if it were only in one place The center of gravity is a closely related term It is the point where an object can be balanced perfectly by a sharp point holding it up under the object It is the center of mass acting in a gravitation al field
