In machine learning supervised learning is the task of wikt infer inferring a function from labelled training data The results of the training are known beforehand the system simply learns how to get to these results correctly Usually such systems work with vector s They get the training data and the result of the training as two vectors and produce a classifier Usually the system uses inductive reasoning to generalize the training data
