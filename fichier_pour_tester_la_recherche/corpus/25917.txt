 Dendrites are the branches of neuron s that receive signals from other neurons and pass the signals into the cell body A cell may have hundreds or thousands of dendrites but may have only one axon The dendrites carry signals from other neurons into the soma whereas the axon carries a single signal from the soma to the next neuron or to a muscle fiber A dendrite from one neuron and an axon from another neuron meet at a synapse which is a very narrow gap between the two cells When electrical impulses reach the end of an axon the signal must pass over a synapse again There are two types of synapse Chemical Synapse chemical or Electrical synapse electrical If it s a chemical synapse the active potential triggers the release of special chemicals called neurotransmitters from the axon These chemicals cross the synapse to the dendrite where they trigger the flow of ions into or out of the cell The movement of the charged ions in the dendrite causes an electrical current which spreads to the soma briefly before being restored to normal If the current is positively charged it will make the soma then it will set off a chain reaction in a part of the soma called the axon hillock The axon hillock is the place where the soma connects to the axon The chain reaction that begins in the axon hillock is a strong electrical current called an action potential that flows down the axon to the next synapse
