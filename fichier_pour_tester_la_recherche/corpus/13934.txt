The electrical resistance of an electrical conductor is a measure of the difficulty of passing an electric current through that conductor It explains the relationship between voltage With more resistance in a circuit less electricity will flow through the circuit Resistance discovered by Georg Ohm Georg Simon Ohm in is the ratio between voltage and current Ohm s law said that the voltage between any two points in a Electrical conductor conductor changes directly as the current between the two points given the temperature remains the same He described it with the equation which models the ratio where is the resistance of the object measured in ohm s is the voltage across the object measured in volt s is the current going through the object measured in ampere s
