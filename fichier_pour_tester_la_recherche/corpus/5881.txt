 LS or SuperDisk is a high speed high capacity alternative to the mm MB floppy disk It is called High density media The main advantage when compared to FDD and ZD is the possibility to use the united mechanism for these special diskettes even for FDD and ZD This SuperDisk was introduced by Iomega in as ZD But the SuperDisks were not expanded because of slowness and unreliability in comparison with ZD SuperDisk MB Diskettes may still be available in the marketplace however are no longer warranted We do not have information about where these products can be purchased Once a drive fails it may be impossible or expensive to get data off the diskettes SuperDisk diskettes are etched with a servo pattern at the factory This pattern is then read by the SuperDisk drive to precisely align the read write head The result is that a SuperDisk diskette can have tracks as opposed to the tracks that conventional inch MB diskettes use Unlike other removable disk storage solutions such as the Zip drive SuperDisk is backward compatible with older diskettes This means that the same SuperDisk drive can be used to read and write to older MB diskettes as well as the new MB SuperDisk diskettes Here are some current data storage and backup technologies that Imation supplies for a variety of customer needs A combination of backup media may be the best course for instance backing up currently used files to Flash Drives or Micro Drives and keeping seldom used files on DVD or Compact disc CD that snapbacks are back
