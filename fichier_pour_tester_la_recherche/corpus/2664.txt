The electronvolt or electron volt symbol eV is used to measure energy It is defined as the amount of energy an electron gains after being accelerated by volt of electricity Joule s are used often for energy measurement but it is sometimes useful to use electronvolts for very small amounts of energy To convert joules into electronvolts divide joules by the charge of an electron which is about E g J eV The electronvolt is often used in atomic physics atomic Nuclear physics nuclear and particle physics For example the energy of photon s can be measured by the voltage necessary to overcome their photoelectric effect
