 Intercropping is growing two or more crop s next to each other at the same time The main purpose of intercropping is to produce more crops in a given area It also makes use of resources that would otherwise not be used by a single crop Crops are selected such that their nutrient requirements are different This way the crops can give the same returns but require less space Things to consider when choosing which crops to mix include the soil climate and Variety varieties It is very important not to have crops competing with each other for space nutrients water or sunlight An example of an intercropping strategy is planting one crop that has deep root s with another that has shallow roots Intercropping has been proposed as an alternative to slash and burn farming which is very bad for the environment
