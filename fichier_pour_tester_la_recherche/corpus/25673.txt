A hydrogen bond is a low kind type of Intermolecular force Dipole dipole interactions dipole dipole Chemical bond bond that exists between an electronegative molecule and a hydrogen molecule bonded to another electronegative molecule This type of bond always involves a hydrogen molecule That explains the name Hydrogen bonds can occur between molecules The typical hydrogen bond is stronger than Van der Waals force van der Waals forces but weaker than covalent bond covalent ionic bond ionic and metallic bond s Intermolecular hydrogen bonding is responsible for the high boiling point of water
