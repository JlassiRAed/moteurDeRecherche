The Biellmann spin is a spin in figure skating It is performed on one foot The free leg is pulled up from behind and pulled above the head The knee is bent slightly and the back is bent backwards into the spin This forms a teardrop position with the body In the classic version of the spin both arms are used to hold up the leg A slightly changed version has one hand on the skate and the other hand on the arm holding up the skate A change can be made in that one hand can be dropped If the hand holding up the spin is on the same side of the body as the leg the spin is referred to as a one hand Biellmann spin because the spin is being performed with one hand If the hand holding up the spin is on the opposite side of the body as the leg the spin is referred to as a cross grab Biellmann spin because that hand has to cross the body to grab the skate The spin has also been said to look like a tulip on a turntable It is one of the most iconic figure skating moves Along with the layback spin the Biellmann is used in advertisements and icons representing figure skating The position is also used in spiral sequences
