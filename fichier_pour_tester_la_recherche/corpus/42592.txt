The Cross of Gold speech was a famous speech at the Democratic National Convention by William Jennings Bryan He wanted silver and not gold to be America s bullion standard It was his goal to create inflation to help those in debt The end of the speech gives it its name when he says Having behind us the producing masses of this United States nation and the world supported by the commercial interests the laboring interests and the toilers everywhere we will answer their demand for a gold standard by saying to them You shall not press down upon the brow of labor this crown of Spine thorns you shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold
