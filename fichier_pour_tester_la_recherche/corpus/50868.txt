The word fiddle refers to a violin when used in folk music Many people also use it simply as a fun word for violin Someone who plays the fiddle is a fiddler The bow bow is sometimes called a fiddling stick Fiddle playing or fiddling is a style of folk music The word fiddle is also used for instruments of several hundred years ago which developed into the violin These instruments varied a lot from one country to another and one time to another They were of different shapes and sizes and even had many different names Often they were held against the chest instead of being tucked under the chin In the Middle Ages a small narrow violin called a kit was often used by dancing masters It was small enough to be put in a pocket In south eastern Europe there was even a fiddle with a belly made of skin Fiddle strings were usually made of gut Many fiddles have bridge Many fiddlers have not received classical training but have learned by listening to other fiddlers and copying them The music they play is dance music Classical violin playing developed out of country fiddle playing Most fiddlers use bows which are the same as violin bows but in some countries such as Hungary they use shorter heavier bows with horse hair that is tied around the frog With this type of bow the player tightens the hair by squeezing it while playing Fiddles were played by people from all areas of society from noble people to simple peasant s Many of them were minstrel s who entertained important people Some of them may have been able to read sheet music music but many would have learned by copying other players and memorizing the music At important feasts the minstrels may have played music while walking up to the high table when the food was brought in They played to accompaniment accompany dancing dancers and singer s and even acrobat s We can see from old painting s that they sometimes played with other instruments such as trumpet s drum s or percussion We do not know the music they played because it was never written down but some tunes we still hear today may have come from those old tunes since some people still learn tunes by ear from people who learned them by ear and so on Some American old time tunes and some Brittany Breton tunes may have come to us in this way for example
