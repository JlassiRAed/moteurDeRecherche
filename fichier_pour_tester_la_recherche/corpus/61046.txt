In an experiment the variable s used can be classed as either dependent or independent variables The dependent variable is the possible outcome of the experiment the wikt effect effect It wikt depend depends on what happens to other variables in the experiment The dependent variable is basically the part that you are changing For example if you want to know how much light a plant needs to grow the amount of growth is the dependent If you wanted to see if a plant would grow better in hot or cold areas your independent variable would be the temperature of the area the plant The independent variable is the variable that you have control over what you can choose and manipulate It is usually what you think will affect the dependent variable In some cases you may not be able to manipulate the independent variable It may be something that is already there and is fixed something you would like to evaluate with respect to how it affects something else the independent variable like color kind time As an example you are interested in how Stress stress affects heart rate in humans Your independent variable would be the stress and the dependent variable would be the heart rate You can directly manipulate stress levels in your human subjects and measure how those stress levels change heart rate
