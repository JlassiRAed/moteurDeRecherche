A tinnitus masker is an electronic device that produces noise at low levels and is used by those experiencing tinnitus to cover up the ringing or other sounds they are hearing Many people who experience tinnitus also have hearing loss and are able to use a hearing aid that also acts as a tinnitus masker These devices will usually need to be customised by an audiologist to ensure that the masking noise used brings relief to the user as tinnitus is experienced differently by everyone
