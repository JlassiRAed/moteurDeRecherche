 Backward compatibility refers to hardware or software that can successfully use interface s and data from earlier versions of the system or with other systems For example Perl the scripting language was designed to be backward compatible with awk an earlier language that Perl was designed to replace Backward compatibility is more easily accomplished if the previous versions have been designed to be forward compatible or extensible with built in features such as hooks plug in or an application program interface that allows the addition of new features The term backward combatible each other In this case the two versions cannot share data easily and may have features that cause errors or crashes when they are installed on the same computer often because the computer does not understand which version is being referred to Even if the earlier version is removed remaining vestiges of it may cause problems in running the newer version
