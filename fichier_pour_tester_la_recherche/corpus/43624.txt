 Time dilation is a physics concept about changes in the passage of time as related to relativity It is a difference of elapsed time between two events as measured by observers In Albert Einstein s theories of relativity there are two types of time dilation Case In special relativity clocks that are moving run slower according to a stationary observer s clock This effect does not come from workings of the clocks but from the nature of spacetime Case the observers may be in positions with different gravitation al masses In general relativity clocks that are near a strong gravitational field run slower than clocks in a weaker gravitational field
