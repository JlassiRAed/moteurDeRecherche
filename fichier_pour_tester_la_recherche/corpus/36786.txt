The cathode ray tube or CRT was invented by Karl Ferdinand Braun It was the most common type of display device display for many years It was used in almost all computer monitor s and television s until LCD and plasma display plasma screen s started being used A cathode ray tube is an electron gun The cathode is an electrode The cathode is inside a glass tube Also inside the glass tube is an anode that attracts electrons This is used to pull the electrons toward the front of the glass tube so the electrons shoot out in one direction like a ray gun To better control the direction of the electrons the air is taken out of the tube making a vacuum The electrons hit the front of the tube where a phosphor screen is The electrons make the phosphor light up The electrons can be aimed by creating a magnetic field By carefully controlling which bits of phosphor light up a bright picture can be made on the front of the vacuum tube Changing this picture times every second will make it look like the picture is moving Because there is a vacuum inside the tube and the tube must be glass for the phosphor to be visible the tube must be made of thick glass For a large television this vacuum tube can be quite heavy The cathode ray tube was invented in and used as an oscilloscope Later along with other inventions and improvements it was used for the first modern electronic television by Philo T Farnsworth in the s The CRT was the main type of television screen until the liquid crystal display became popular in the early s
