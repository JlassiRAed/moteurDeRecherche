 CNDO is the short cut for Complete Neglect of Differential Overlap It is both a wikt method method for learning key facts about molecular orbital s as well as the name of a particular set of computer program s CNDO is based on quantum chemistry It is one of the first semi empirical quantum chemistry methods It uses two approximation s core approximation only the outer valence electron s are explicitly included zero differential overlap CNDO builds a mathematical model of a molecule CNDO starts with the position of the positive ly charged Nucleus nuclei of the atom s and the negative ly charged electron cloud s surrounding them Quantum chemistry tells the model the probability distribution of electron locations based on atomic orbital s From this information CNDO computes Information data about the resulting molecular orbital s CNDO is the main version of CNDO John Pople and coworkers first wrote CNDO J Pople and D Beveridge Approximate Molecular Orbital Theory McGraw Hill
