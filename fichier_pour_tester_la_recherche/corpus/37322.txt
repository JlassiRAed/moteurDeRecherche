 The Icteridae are a family family of small to medium sized New World songbirds They are usually brightly colored Most species have black as a main plumage color often enlivened by yellow orange or red The family is extremely varied in size shape behavior and coloration This group includes the New World blackbird s New World oriole s the bobolink meadowlark s grackle s cowbird s oropendola s and cacique or the Old World oriole s Icterids are unusual in songbirds because they have considerable sexual dimorphism For example the male great tailed grackle is heavier than the female The smallest icterid species is the orchard oriole in which the female averages cm in length and This variation in size is greater than usual in passerine families One unusual adaptation shared by the icterids is gaping where the skull allows them to open their beak bills strongly rather than passively This lets them force open gaps to get at hidden food
