 Allometry is the study of the relationship of body size to shape In most cases the relative size of body parts changes as the body grows Most allometric relationships are adaptive For example organs which depend on their surface area grow faster as the body weight increases Also there are changes in allometry as a clade evolves Changes in time of development in an evolutionary series or clade are very common The trend is known as heterochrony Allometry was first outlined by Otto Snell in cite book The relationship between two measured quantities is often expressed as a power law where is the scaling exponent of the law
