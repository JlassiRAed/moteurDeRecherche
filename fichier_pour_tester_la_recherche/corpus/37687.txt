A Bloom filter is a data structure that allows computers to see if a given Set Element of element occurs in a set Citation Edward Bloom proposed the Bloom filter in In the article Bloom supposes there is an algorithm to hyphenate words at the end of a line According to the example most words have simple hyphenation patterns But about of the words require time consuming lookups to fetch the correct rule His case was that of hyphenating about words He saw that using the normal error free hashing techniques storing the hyphenation patterns would require a lot of memory He found that using his technique he could eliminate most lookups For example a hash area only of the size needed by an ideal error free hash still eliminates of the disk accesses More generally fewer than bit s per element are required for a false positive probability independent of the size or number of elements in the set Citation
