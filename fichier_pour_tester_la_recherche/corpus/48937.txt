A girl group is a music group with a group of female singer s who normally harmony harmonise together The term girl group is also used in a narrower sense in English speaking countries It suggests the American female pop singing groups of the late s and early s They were hugely successful for a time between the Rock and roll decline decline of early rock and roll and the British Invasion Many of them were influenced by doo wop style In the s and s the groups were mostly self organised girls who knew each other and often grew up together The Chantels for example were four girl chorister s from a Catholic high school in the Bronx These groups had managers of course because they needed someone to deal with the music industry But the managers did not set up the groups they came after the groups were formed Later almost all groups were created by public relations professionals to meet a market need The Spice Girls were a good example of this They were put together in the mid s by a family management team Their managers idea was to create a girl group to compete with popular boy bands that dominated the pop music scene in the mid to late s One obvious difference between the earlier groups and the later ones was in their social backgrounds Earlier American groups having grown up together were all of the same social origin and colour What is more they had usually sung together and socialised together before they formed up as a group This is also true of most of the earlier British boy groups The later groups on the other hand were deliberately chosen for variety This was done so that all sections of the audience would have at least one member they could identify with They had not sung together or maybe met each other until their PR manager introduced them With the changing times the marketing of popular music changed greatly so that direct comparison of sales is not simple but in many parts of the world digital sales are now the most important
