In statistics a population is a set of things from which sample samples may be drawn This allows statistical inference s to be drawn or estimate s made of the total population For example if we were interested in crow s then we would sample the set of crows which is of interest The population of crows is limited to crows that exist now or in the future Probably geography will be a limitation in practice To fairly represent the whole population a sample needs to be random sample random Population is also used to refer to a set of measurement s or values not only cases actually observed Suppose for example we are interested in the set of all adult crows now alive in the county of Cambridgeshire and we want to know the mean mean weight of these birds For each bird in the population of crows there is a weight and the set of these weights is called the population of weights math stub
