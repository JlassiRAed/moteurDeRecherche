 Space time is a mathematical model that joins Space space and time into a single idea called a continuum This four dimensional continuum is known as Minkowski spacetime Minkowski space Combining these two ideas helped cosmology to understand how the universe works on the big level In non relativistic classical mechanics the use of Euclidean space instead of space time is good because time is treated as universal with a constant rate of passage which is independent of the state of motion of an observer But in a relativity relativistic universe time cannot be separated from the three dimensions of space This is because the observed rate at which time passes depends on an object s velocity relative to the observer Also the strength of any gravitational field slows the passage of time for an object as seen by an observer outside the field
