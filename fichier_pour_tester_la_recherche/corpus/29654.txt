An N Type semiconductor is created by adding pentavalent impurities like phosphorus A pentavalent impurity is called a donor because it is ready to give a free electron to a semiconductor The impurities are called dopants The purpose of doing this is to make more charge carriers or electrons available in the material for conduction In n type semiconductors the number of electrons is more than the holes so electrons are measured as majority charge carriers and holes are referred as minority charge carriers
