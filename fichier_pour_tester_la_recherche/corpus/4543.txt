Piezoelectric material generates a small electrical voltage when its shape is deformed This can be by as little as a change and can produce mAh worth of electricity at V When processed the piezoelectric crystal become sharper as they get refined through heating and cooling This process makes the material much more sensitive to changes in pressure as well as increases their resistance to compressive stress that would impede its ability to function
