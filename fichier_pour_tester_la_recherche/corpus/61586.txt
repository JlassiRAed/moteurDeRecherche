 Linear independence is a concept from linear algebra It is used to talk about vector space s Each vector space has a null vector This vector is expressed as a linear combination of other vectors A set of these vectors is called linearly independent if and only if all of them are needed to express this null vector This is equivalent to saying that at least one of the vectors can be expressed as a linear combination of the others If the vectors are not linearly independent they are called linearly dependent As an example take the three dimensional Euclidean space begin matrix mbox independent qquad underbrace overbrace begin bmatrix end bmatrix begin bmatrix end bmatrix begin bmatrix end bmatrix begin bmatrix end bmatrix mbox dependent end matrix Here the first three vectors are linearly independent but the fourth vector equals nine times the first plus five times the second plus four times the third so the four vectors together are linearly dependent Linear dependence is a property of the family not of any particular vector for example in this case we could just as well write the first vector as a linear combination of the last three
