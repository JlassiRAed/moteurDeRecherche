 Viscosity is a physical property of fluid s It shows resistance to flux flow In a simple example water has a low viscosity as it is thin Syrup or tar on the other hand has a high viscosity as it is thick So next time you drink something think about the viscosity A way to test for viscosity is the speed at which the substance runs down a slope Syrup would reach the bottom very slowly whereas water would be a lot quicker There are two types of viscosity fluid dynamics dynamic viscosity measured in pascal seconds and kinematic viscosity measured in metres per second Square squared Viscosity is used as a way to predict when volcanoes erupt When the lava comes out very thickly then it just flows out like water The word viscous comes from the Latin viscum meaning sticky
