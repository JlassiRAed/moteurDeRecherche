A Secure Digital card the wrong way There are different kinds of cards Those labeled SD with capacities up to GB Those labeled SDHC with capacities between GB and GB Those labeled SDXC with capacities of up to TB SD and SDHC are not compatible but devices that accept SDHC also accept SD cards The interface of SDHC and SDXC cards is the same but SDXC uses a different file system Some devices that originally shipped only with support for SD can be made to support SDHC with a firmware update There are also different classes These refer to the read and write speeds Currently in use are Class which means MBytes second Class MB sec and Class at MB sec The problem with this is that different manufacturers measure different things with it some measure write speeds others read speeds There are also differences because some give guarantees and others simply say that the speeds they indicate are the maximum achievable under good conditions Still another measurement is called rating A rating of corresponds to KBytes per second the read speed of a Compact disc CD That way a class is equal to a speed of x microSD cards do the same thing but are much smaller
