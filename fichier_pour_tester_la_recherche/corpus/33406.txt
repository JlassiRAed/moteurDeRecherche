 Sewall Green Wright path analysis With R A Fisher and J B S Haldane he was a founder of theoretical population genetics He is the discoverer of the inbreeding coefficient and of methods of computing it in pedigree s He extended this work to populations calculating the degree of inbreeding of members of populations as a result of random genetic drift Together with Fisher he pioneered methods for calculating the distribution of gene frequency frequencies among populations as a result of the interaction of natural selection mutation migration and genetic drift The work of Fisher Wright and Haldane on theoretical population genetics was a major step in the development of the modern evolutionary synthesis of genetics with evolution Wright also made contributions to mammalian genetics and biochemical genetics
