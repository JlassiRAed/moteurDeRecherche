 Radio waves make up part of the electromagnetic spectrum These wave wave s are packets of energy with differing wavelength s similar to visible light waves X ray s or gamma ray s except longer A radio wave like other electromagnetic waves is similar to an ocean wave or any other type of wave Both types of wave have a hill and valley shape repeating over and over A wavelength is measured as the distance from the top of one crest to the top of its neighboring crest While the wavelength of visible light is very very small less than one micrometer and much less than the thickness of a human hair radio waves can have a wavelength from a couple centimeter s to several metre meter s They also have a radio frequency The smallest radio waves are called microwave s Shortwave s are not quite so small There are also medium and long waves Antenna s designed to send and receive radio waves are usually similar in size to the wavelength they are to use Many radio antennas Manmade radio waves have been used for a long time for communication and to see objects Radar uses radio waves to see distant objects by Reflection bouncing waves off an object and seeing how long it takes for the waves to return Radar can even be used to find oil or see what chemicals are in soil Radio s also use these waves to send and receive information Natural radio waves were first discovered in the s by Karl Guthe Jansky working for Bell Laboratories Before his discovery everyone thought only people could wikt generate generate radio waves Bell was detecting static on radio channels and had Jansky try to figure out where this static or interference was coming from Surprisingly the interference was coming from space This discovery eventually led astronomer s to look at radio waves along with light wave s to find things in the sky These radio astronomers use giant Radio telescope s shaped like satellite dish es to gather and study the waves Radio waves are used for many things today Broadcasting and communications satellite s and mobile phone s and many computer s communicate by radio waves
