An alkaliphile is an organism that thrives in extremely alkali alkaline conditions that are Harm harmful to most life on Earth To be considered an alkaliphile the organism must have optimal growth in Environment environments with a pH level of or above Surviving and growing in an environment that has a high pH level is very difficult Many processes in the cell are obstructed by high pH levels Alkaline conditions change DNA and make the plasma membrane of the cell unstable Alkaliphiles have two basic methods of dealing with these problems Either they have a way of making the environment more acid ic or they have adapted the cellular processes so that they work best in highly alkaline conditions To determine which of the two mechanisms a specific organism uses experiment s are needed
