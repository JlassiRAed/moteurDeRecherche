In chemistry a molecular orbital mathematical function which describes the wave like behaviour of an electron in a molecule Chemist s use such functions to predict or explain chemistry chemical and physics physical property properties For example the functions can tell the probability of finding an electron in any specific region Chemists usually build mathematical model s of molecular orbitals by combining atomic orbital s Hybrid orbital s from each atom of the molecule or other molecular orbitals from groups of atoms can also be used Computer s can work on these functions Molecular orbitals allow chemists to apply quantum mechanics to study molecules MOs answer questions about how the atoms in molecules stick together The various rounded shapes in an orbital diagram indicate where electrons would most likely be found in an atom
