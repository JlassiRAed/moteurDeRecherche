 RNA splicing is a stage in Transcription which transfers the code from DNA to proteins is built in two stages In the first stage each gene is translated into a pre mRNA Then the exons in pre mRNAs are joined by splicing which is done in the spliceosome s This is needed because the gene is split into code sections called exons and non coding sections called intron s The exons are brought together by splicing So in molecular biology splicing is a process where intron s are removed and exon s are joined This makes the final mRNA This messenger RNA is then used to produce a correct protein by translation translation
