 Graptolithina Enteropneusta Pterobranchia The Hemichordata is a Phylum C J et al Evaluating hypotheses of deuterostome phylogeny and chordate evolution with new LSU and SSU ribosomal DNA data Molecular Biology and Evolution Living hemichordates are a phylum with two living classes the enteropneusts and the pterobranchs Since the hemichordates are the closest living relatives to the chordate s they are of great interest to those studying the origins of chordate development
