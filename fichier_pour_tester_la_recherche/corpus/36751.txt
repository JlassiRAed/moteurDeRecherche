 Scanning tunneling microscopy The STM is based on something called quantum tunneling When a metal tip is brought very near to a metal or semiconductor semiconducting surface a voltage between the two can allow electron s to flow through the vacuum between them Changes in current as the probe goes over the surface is what makes the picture STM can be a hard thing to do as it needs very clean surfaces and sharp tips
