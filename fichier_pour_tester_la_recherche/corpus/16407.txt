In the light dependent reaction light energy from the sun is used to split water which has been taken in by plants Water when broken makes oxygen hydrogen and electron s These electrons move through structures in chloroplasts and by chemiosmosis make ATP The hydrogen is converted to NADPH which is then used in the light independent reactions Oxygen diffusion diffuses out of the plant as a waste product of photosynthesis This all happens in the grana thylakoid of chloroplasts
