 Kinematics is the branch of classical mechanics which describes the motion without looking at the cause of this motion cite book title A Treatise on the Analytical Dynamics of Particles and Rigid Bodies author Edmund Taylor Whittaker url cite book cite book cite bookTo describe motion kinematics studies the paths of points line lines and other geometry geometric objects in Space space and some of their properties such as velocity and acceleration Astrophysics uses kinematics to describe the motion of celestial bodies and systems Mechanical engineering robotics and biomechanics use it to describe the motion of systems composed of joined parts such as an engine a robotic arm or the Human skeleton skeleton of the human body The study of kinematics can be abstracted into purely mathematical function s It is possible to represent rotation with elements of the unit circle in the complex plane Other Non Euclidean geometry Planar algebras planar algebras are used to represent the shear mapping of classical motion in absolute time and space and to represent the Lorentz transformation s of relativistic space and time Mathematicians have developed a science of Non Euclidean geometry Kinematic geometries kinematic geometry which uses time as a parameter Certain geometric transformations which are called rigid transformation s have been developed to describe the movement of components of a mechanical system These transformations simplify the derivation of its equations of motion and is central to Lagrangian mechanics dynamic analysis robot kinematics Kinematic analysis is the process of measuring the Physical quantity kinematic quantities used to describe motion In engineering kinematic analysis may be used to find the range of movement for a given Mechanism mechanism
