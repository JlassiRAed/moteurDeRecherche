A reduced instruction set computing instructions execute very fast RISC was developed as an alternative to what is now known as Complex instruction set computer CISC However there are CPU design s other than RISC and CISC Some examples are VLIW Minimal instruction set computer MISC OISC massive parallel processing systolic array reconfigurable computing and dataflow architecture The main feature of a RISC Central processing unit processors is a small core logic which allows design ers to increase the number of the Processor register register set and increase internal parallelism using one of the following methods Instruction level parallelism which increases the rate at which instructions are executed within a CPU Thread level parallelism threads the CPU can execute in parallel Other features which are typically found in RISC architectures are Well known RISC Central processing unit processors include DEC Alpha Alpha ARC International ARC ARM architecture ARM Atmel AVR AVR MIPS architecture MIPS PA RISC PIC microcontroller PIC Power Architecture SuperH and SPARC
