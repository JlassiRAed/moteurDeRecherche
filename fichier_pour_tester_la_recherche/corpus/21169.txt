The Concentric zone model or Burgess model is a model to explain how a Human settlement settlement such as a city will grow It was developed by Ernest W Burgess between and Burgess looked at the growth of Chicago in the late th and early th century Many people moved to Chicago at that time The model was the first to explain why certain groups of people lived in certain areas of the city Burgess said that there were circles around the center of the city The circle a piece of land was in determined how it was used Burgess saw different zones starting at the center The Central Business District the center of the city A zone of mixed use with both commercial buildings and residential ones Low class residential homes these were later called inner suburb s housing is cheap standard of living is low Higher class residential zone later called outer suburbs Better quality of life more expensive to live there Commuter zoneBurgess saw that richer people tended to live farther away from the city center When the city grew the city center would grow the rings would also shift outwards The model also has some problems for example It assumes that the city can grow in every direction physical features often limit city growth though Commuter village s cannot be explained with the model they are far from the city but often have cheap housing
