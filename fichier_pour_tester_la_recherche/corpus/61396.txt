The Hubble Ultra Deep Field or HUDF is an image of a small part of outer space space in the constellation Fornax It took more than months to capture this image from September through January It is the furthest image of the universe ever taken by human s The HUDF contains an about galaxy galaxies The patch of sky where the galaxies are was chosen because it has few bright stars in the near field Although most of the targets visible in the Hubble image can also be seen at infrared wavelengths by ground based telescopes Hubble is the only instrument which can make observations of these distant targets at visible wavelengths Southwest of Orion on the celestial sphere The star near the center of the field is USNO A with apparent magnitude of In total the image required exposures taken over the course of Hubble orbits around Earth The total amount of exposure time was days for the Advanced Camera for Surveys ACS and days for the Near Infrared Camera and Multi Object Spectrometer NICMOS
