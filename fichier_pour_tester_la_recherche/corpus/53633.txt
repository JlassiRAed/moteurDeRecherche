 Idempotence is a property that an operation in mathematics or computer science may have It roughly means that the operation can be carried out again and again without changing the result The word idempotence was made by Benjamin Pierce because he saw the concept when studying algebra The meaning is different if we are talking about different kinds of operations It can also be used to describe elements than an operation can take We say that an element c in the domain of f is an idempotent element if f This means that f is idempotent if every element of its domain is an idempotent element We say that an element c which can take is an idempotent element for if c
