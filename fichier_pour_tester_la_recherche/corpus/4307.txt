The Suda or Souda The Suda is somewhere between a grammatical dictionary and an encyclopedia in the modern sense It explains the source derivation and meaning of words according to the philology of its period There is nothing especially important about this aspect of the work It is the articles on literary history that are valuable These entries supply details and quotations from authors whose works are otherwise lost This lexicon represents a convenient work of reference for persons who played a part in political ecclesiastical and literary history in the East down to the tenth century The chief source for this is the encyclopedia of Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus The work deals with Bible biblical as well as paganism pagan subjects from which it is inferred that the writer was a Christianity Christian A prefatory note gives a list of dictionaries from which the lexical portion was compiled together with the names of their authors The work is uncritical and probably much added to and the value of the articles is very unequal Nevertheless it contains much information on ancient history and life The Souda has a near contemporaneous Islamic parallel the Kitab al Fehrest of Ibn al Nadim
