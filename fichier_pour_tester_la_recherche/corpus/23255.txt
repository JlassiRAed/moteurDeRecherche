 Turbidity is a measurement measure of how well light penetrates water It is caused by particle s that are generally invisible to the naked eye The measurement of turbidity is a key test of water quality Fluids can contain suspended particles of many different sizes Some suspended material will be large enough and heavy enough to settle rapidly to the bottom if a liquid sample is left to stand Very small particles settle very slowly or not at all if the sample is regularly Agitator agitated or the particles are colloid al These small solid particles cause the liquid to appear turbid or murky
