A food web is similar to a food chain but larger and it is a diagram that combines many food chains into one picture Food webs show how plant s and animal s are connected in many ways to help them all wikt survive survive unlike food chains that just follow one path For example a tree produces acorn acorns this is called the producer Mice squirrel s and insects eat these acorns and because there are many mice the weasels snakes and Raccoon raccoons have food With insects in the acorns other predators would be attracted and therefore foxes hawks or owls could all find food Food webs can be effected in many ways considering the urban area s of major countries are taking no action and care It uses arrows to show the energy relationships among organisms
