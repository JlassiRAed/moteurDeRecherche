 Analogy is an important way of thinking A person sees something new and thinks what is it Then he might think Ah it s like something I have seen before So an analogy is a comparison between two things which we think are similar in some way We compare two things or two systems and think they have something important in common In general such arguments belong in the category of inductive reasoning since their conclusions do not follow with certainty but are only supported with varying degrees of strength Bartha Paul Analogy and analogical reasoning Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy There is a difference between superficial analogies and profound analogies Two things might look alike but work quite differently or they might look different but work in ways like each other Most effort is put into finding profound analogies which teach us something worth knowing As another philosopher puts is The goal has been to find the formal criteria that distinguish good from bad analogical inference These efforts have met with mixed success at best Norton J D Formal and material approaches to analogical inference Mario Bunge sees analogy as a main way of getting new hypotheses which can be tested He points out that analogies may be based on similarities in behaviour or in structure
