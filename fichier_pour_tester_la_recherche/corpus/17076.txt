 Atmospheric chemistry is a branch of science in which the chemistry of the Atmosphere of Earth Earth s atmosphere and that of other planets is studied It is a multidisciplinarity multidisciplinary field of research and draws on environmental chemistry physics meteorology computer model ing oceanography geology and volcanology and other disciplines Research is connected with other areas of study such as climatology Studying the atmosphere includes studying the interactions between the atmosphere and living organisms The composition of the Earth s atmosphere changes as result of natural processes such as volcano emissions lightning and bombardment by solar particles from the Sun s corona It has also been changed by human activity Some of these changes are harmful to human health crop s and ecosystem s Examples of problems include acid rain ozone depletion photochemistry photochemical smog greenhouse gas es and global warming Atmospheric chemists study the causes of these problems Atmospheric chemists offer Scientific theory theories about these problems then test the theories and possible solutions Atmospheric chemists also note the effects of changes in government policy
