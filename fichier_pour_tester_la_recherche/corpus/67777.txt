The black hole information paradox is a phenomenon in astrophysics It is when quantum mechanics and general relativity are put together This phenomenon states that the information a physical system has can be lost when it enters a black hole The object that falls into a black hole only keeps information about its Spin spin mass and charge However the quantum mechanics says that information cannot be lost This makes it a paradox
