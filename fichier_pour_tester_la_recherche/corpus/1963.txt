A mathematical model is a description of a system using mathematics mathematical concepts and language The process of building a mathematical model is termed mathematical modeling Mathematical models are used in the natural sciences Physicist s engineer s statistician s operations research analysts and economist s use mathematical models a lot Mathematical models can take many forms The types of models include dynamical system s for systems that change statistical model s for finding patterns in large groups of measurements or data differential equation s to study how variables change over time or Game theory game theoretic models for studying how many independent decision makers can interact These and other types of models can overlap with a given model involving a variety of abstract structures Mathematical models can include logical model s In many cases the quality of a scientific field depends on how well the mathematical models built on theory agree with results of repeatable experiments When theoretical mathematical models do not match experimental measurements scientists try to correct the model Such corrections lead the way to better theories to explain the facts
