 Aristophanes was a Ancient Greece Greek writer who wrote plays However only of his plays survive in their entirety He is famous for writing comedy comedies They were biting satire s aimed at famous men of his day and the all too human weaknesses of ordinary people His most famous play Lysistrata is about a group of women who protest against a war by not having sexual intercourse with their husbands until the war is ended Ancient Greek theatre was first presented in competitions at the festival of Dionysia dedicated to the god Dionysus The interesting thing is that Aristophanes did not always win first prize The plays which won ahead of his have been lost so we cannot make any comparisons
