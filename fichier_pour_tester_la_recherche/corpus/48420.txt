The lung is an Organ It gives blood oxygen from the air and takes away carbon dioxide Most vertebrate s have lungs In animals the lungs are the area where gas exchange takes place Without gas exchange oxygen would not pass into the blood from the lungs so the body cells would not be able to receive the oxygen needed for respiration The alveoli are moist to allow oxygen to move from the lung through the alveoli into blood vessels and red blood cells Carbon dioxide passes from the blood into the alveoli The oxygen filled blood goes back to the heart and the carbon dioxide in the alveoli is pushed out of the lungs and into the air we breathe out
