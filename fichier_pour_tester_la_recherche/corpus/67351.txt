 Anzu is a genus of oviraptorosaur ian dinosaur s from the latest Cretaceous million years ago Its remains were found in North Dakota North and South Dakota The type species is Anzu wyliei Anzu wyliei had a toothless beak a prominent crest long arms ending in slender relatively straight claws long powerful legs with slender toes and a very long tail In life the animal was about in weight It was one of the largest known oviraptorosaurs and the largest known from North America e The type species is the first well preserved example of a North American oviraptorosaur According to a paleontologist at the National Museum of Natural History Smithsonian for almost a hundred years the presence of oviraptorosaurs in North America was only known from a few bits of skeleton and the details of their appearance and biology remained a mystery With the discovery of A wyliei we finally have the fossil evidence to show what this species looked like and how it is related to other dinosaurs The fossils of Anzu wyliei were found in mudstone rock that had once been part of ancient floodplain s Its Asian counterparts lived in arid or semi arid conditions Its lifestyle was that of a fast running ecological generalist that didn t quite fit the usual moulds of meat eating or plant eating dinosaur It was not on the direct line of descent of modern birds but it did have bird like features it would have had a lot of birdy behaviors When people think of a dinosaur they think of something like a T rex or a brontosaurus and when they think of a bird they think of something like a sparrow or a chicken This animal Anzu has a mosaic of features of both of those groups The function of Anzu s large crest is debated The crest is very large and made of paper thin bone so it was not able to take much stress All oviraptosaurs have this crest but it is certainly the largest in A wyliei The most likely function is for display signalling to members of its own species Also it might be used to attract a mate The fossils showed evidence of injuries including a healed broken rib and an arthritic toe that was probably the result of a tendon being ripped away from the bone It is not known whether this indicates that the animals fought each other or were injured by predators
