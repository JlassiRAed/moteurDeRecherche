A seizure response dog is a dog who is specially trained to help its owner during a seizure These dogs jobs may include Getting help by finding a human hitting an alarm or using a pre programmed phone to call Protecting their owner from getting hurt either by pulling unsafe things away or by blocking people who try to walk into obstacles and onto streets Bracing the person having the seizure so they don t fall or hurt themselves or turning the person on their side Waking the unconscious owner during or after a seizureCertain kinds of dogs are able to predict that a person is about to have an epilepsy epileptic seizure This gives the person time to get to a safe place before the seizure starts Usually people say that dogs develop this behavior spontaneously or over some time There have been some studies where dogs were trained to alert to seizures when they were given rewards for correctly predicting seizures but these studies were only partly successful
