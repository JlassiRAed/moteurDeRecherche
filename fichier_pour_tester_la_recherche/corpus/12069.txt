For a general chemical equilibrium the equilibrium constant can be defined by where A is the activity product s in the numerator and those of the reactants in the denominator For equilibria in solution activity is the product of concentration and activity coefficient Most chemists determine equilibrium constants in a solution with a high ionic strength In high strength solutions the quotient of activity coefficients changes very little So the equilibrium constant is defined as a concentration quotient However the value of K will depend on the ionic strength This is a simple idea In an equilibrium atoms can combine or break apart because the reaction can work in both directions For the reaction to work all of the parts must be present to combine This is more likely to happen if the reactants have a higher concentration So the concentrations of all the necessary pieces are multiplied together to get the probability that they will be in the same place for the reaction Going the other way all of the concentrations of those necessary pieces are multiplied together to get the probability that they will be in the same place to react in the opposite direction The ratio between those two numbers represents how popular each side of the reaction will be when equilibrium is reached An equilibrium constant of means that both sides are equally popular Chemists perform experiments to measure the equilibrium constant of various reactions
