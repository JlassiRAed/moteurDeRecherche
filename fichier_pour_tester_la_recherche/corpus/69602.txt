In cryptography an SP network or substitution permutation network is a series of linked Mathematics mathematical operations used in Block cipher block cipher algorithms such as Advanced Encryption Standard AES These networks consist of Substitution box S boxes and Permutation box P boxes that transform blocks of input bit s into output bits S boxes substitute or transform input bits into output bits A good S box will have the property that changing one input bit will change about half of the output bits It will also have the property that each output bit will depend on every input bit P boxes permute or rearrange bits across S box inputs In addition at each round the key key is combined using some Group theory group operation typically XOR
