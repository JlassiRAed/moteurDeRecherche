A neuron is a cell that carries electrical impulses Neurons are the basic units of the nervous system and its most important part is the brain Every neuron is made of a cell body dendrites and an axon Dendrites and axons are nerve fibres There are about billion neurons in the human brain which comprises roughly of all brain cells The neurons are supported by Glial cell glial cells and astrocyte s Neurons are connected to one another and tissues They do not touch and instead form tiny gaps called synapse s These gaps can be Chemical Synapse chemical synapses or Electrical synapse electrical synapses and pass the signal from one neuron to the next
