A quantum computer is a model of how to build a computer The idea is that quantum computers can use certain phenomenon phenomena from quantum mechanics such as quantum superposition superposition and quantum entanglement entanglement to perform operations on Information data The basic principle behind quantum computation is that quantum properties can be used to represent data and perform Instruction operations on it A theoretical model is the quantum Turing machine also known as the universal quantum computer The idea of quantum computing is still very new Experiments have been done In these a very small number of operations were done on qubit s Both practical and theoretical research continues with interest and many national government and military funding agencies support quantum computing research to develop quantum computer s for both civilian and military purposes such as cryptanalysis Today s computers called classical computers store information in binary each bit is either on or off Quantum computation use qubits which in addition to being possibly on or off can be both on and off which is a way of describing superposition until a measurement is made The state of a piece of data on a normal computer is known with certainty but quantum computation uses probabilities Only very simple quantum computers have been built although larger designs have been invented Quantum computation uses a special type of physics quantum physics If large scale quantum computers can be built they will be able to solve some problems much more quickly than any computer that exists today Quantum computers are different from other computers such as DNA computing DNA computers and traditional computers based on transistor s Some computing architectures such as optical computer s cite journal Quantum computers cannot perform functions that are not computability theoretically computable by classical computers in other words they do not alter the Church Turing thesis They would however be able to do many things much more quickly and efficiently
