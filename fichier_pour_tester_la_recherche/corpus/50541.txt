A Faraday cage  or Faraday shield is an wikt enclosure enclosure made from material that electrical conductivity conducts electricity It is used to block  electric field s The Faraday cage is named after the English scientist  Michael Faraday who invented it in An electrical field outside the cage causes electric charges in the cage s conducting material to move around and cancel the field s effect inside the cage It protects sensitive electronic equipment from external radio frequency interference Faraday cages are also used to enclose devices that produce RFI such as radio transmitter s to prevent their radio waves from interfering with other nearby equipment They are also used to protect people and equipment against actual electric currents such as lightning strikes and electrostatic discharges The enclosing cage conducts current round the outside of the enclosed space and none passes though the inside space sci stub
