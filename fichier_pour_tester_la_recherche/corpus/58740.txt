Metallic bonding is the force of attraction between valence electrons and the metal ions It is the sharing of many detached Electron electrons between many positive Ion ions where the electrons act as a glue giving the substance a definite structure It is unlike covalent or ionic bonding The electrons and the positive ions in the metal have a strong attractive force between them Therefore metals often have high melting or boiling points The principle is similar to that of ionic bond s The metallic bond causes many of the traits of metals such as Strength of materials strength malleability ductility luster luster Heat conduction conduction of heat and Electrical conductivity electricity Because the electrons move freely the metal has some electrical conductivity It allows the energy to pass quickly through the electrons generating a Electric current current Metals conduct heat for the same reason the free electrons can transfer the energy at a faster rate than other substances with electrons that are fixed into position There also are few non metals which conduct electricity graphite and ionic compounds that are molten or dissolved in water which have free moving ions Metal bonds have at least one valence electron which they do not share with neighboring atoms and they do not lose electrons to form ions Instead the outer energy levels forms covalent metal metal bonds An alloy is a solution of metals
