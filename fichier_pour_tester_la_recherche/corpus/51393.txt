 Greywacke is a type of sandstone It is hard and dark in color It has different sized grains of quartz feldspar and small rock fragments set in a compact fine clay matrix It is mostly found in Palaeozoic strata The larger grains can be sand to gravel sized and matrix materials make up more than of the rock by volume The origin of greywacke was a problem Gravel sand and mud should not be laid down together because river outflow drops heavier grains first Now geologists think greywacke is formed by submarine avalanche s or strong turbidity currents These actions churn sediment and cause mixed sediment wikt slurry slurries to occur When this happens the resulting rocks show various sedimentary features Support for the turbidity current origin is the fact that deposits of greywacke are found on the edges of the Continental shelf continental shelves at the bottoms of ocean ic trenches and at the bases of mountain formational areas It also occurs in association with black shale s of deep sea origin
