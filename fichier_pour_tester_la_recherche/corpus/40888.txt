 Monoculture is growing a single crop in a large area This is very common in modern agriculture as it allows relatively few people to harvest large amounts Monocultures have problems however It is easier for pest s and disease s to spread in a monocultrure than when crop rotation is used Growing the same crop also puts a strain on the soil which may need to be fertilized to support a monoculture Farmer s who don t understand these problems may ruin their farm
