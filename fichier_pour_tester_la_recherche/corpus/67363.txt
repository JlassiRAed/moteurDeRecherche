A stile is a simple wooden structure which helps people to climb over a fence in the countryside Where there is a footpath which goes through a field with animals there may be a stile so that walkers can climb over out of the field The stile is there instead of a gate If there were a gate and there were animals in the field the animals could escape if the gate were left open Stiles are of course a problem for people who are disabled There are many stiles in the countryside in the United Kingdom Another way of letting walkers through but keeping animals in is to use a kissing gate
