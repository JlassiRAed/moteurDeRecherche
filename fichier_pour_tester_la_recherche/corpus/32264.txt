 Panpsychism is the theory that everything in the universe is somewhat sentient or conscious They are all connected parts of the whole Panpsychists believe that all matter in the universe has some degree of consciousness In other words the substance of the universe is composed entirely of mind or consciousness This is not to say that rocks have a mind but that the individual atoms and other particles in the rock have some sort of awareness and are aware of each other Panpsychism is opposed to materialism or any doctrine that argues that the reality of the universe is composed solely of matter Panpsychism needs no supernatural miracle to explain consciousness it is consciousness In other words we are all part of a grand communication scheme which is the glue that holds the universe together
