 Polarization waves Some waves have motion in another direction as well as the direction of the wave In water for instance the wave will move across the water but something on the surface of the water will move up and down Light wave s are similarly transverse wave s though they are also Photon particles Sound wave s do not have polarization since they are longitudinal wave s
