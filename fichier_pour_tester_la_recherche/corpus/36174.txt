 Immunity is the ability of the body to defend itself from foreign bodies This means rejecting infection s clearing up dust which gets in the lung s and killing cancer cells Vaccination builds on the natural immune system to make a person resist certain disease s Immunity is of two types Innate immunity protects the host against infection but has no memory and so gives no long term immunity The second type is adaptive immunity which does have a kind of memory It does give long term protection against specific pathogen s All animal s plant s and fungi have some innate immunity Vertebrate s also have adaptive immunity People can be immunised from some diseases by having a vaccination By doing so the body learns how the virus bacteria harms the body and will react more quickly to fight the virus bacteria when it comes in contact with the virus bacteria again When your body has defended itself against the virus bacteria it will trap the certain virus bacteria in a net so when the virus bacteria comes back it will be easier to trap those viruses bacteria as well
