An electron shell is the outside part of an atom around the atomic Nucleus nucleus It is a group of atomic orbitals with the same value of the principal quantum number n Electron shells have one or more electron subshells or sublevels These sublevels have two or more orbitals with the same angular momentum quantum number l Electron shells make up the electron configuration of an atom The number of electron s that can be in a shell is equal to The name for electron shells comes from the Bohr model in which groups of electrons were believed to go around the Nucleus nucleus at certain distances so that their orbit s formed shells
