A meteor is what you see when a space rock falls to Earth It is often known as a shooting star or falling star and can be a bright light in the wikt night night sky though most are faint If it hits the ground it is then called a meteorite and a large one sometimes leaves a hole in the ground called a crater A rock that has not yet hit the atmosphere is called a meteoroid Meteoroids may range in size from large pieces of rock to tiny dust particles floating in space that did not form planet s When the meteoroids enter Earth s atmosphere they are usually going faster than the Earth s escape velocity of km sec or Mach number Mach This makes them heat up and usually break apart When the heat makes them glow they are known as meteors Meteors are distinct from comet s or asteroid s but some especially those associated with meteor shower s are dust particles that came out of comets There are several types of meteorites including stony carbonaceous chondrites and iron nickel Stony meteorites are named because they are largely made up of stone like mineral material Carbonaceous chondrites have a high carbon content Iron nickel meteorites are mostly iron often with significant nickel as well Meteors sometimes hurt people and property The Russian meteor event did the most damage Large meteorite strikes may have played a part in several of the mass extinction s and so indirectly on the course of evolution
