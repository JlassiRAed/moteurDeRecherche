In thermodynamics the fugacity is a state function of any wikt isothermal isothermal system The fugacity which has units of pressure represents the wikt tendency tendency of a fluid to escape or expand wikt isothermally isothermally For gas es at low pressures where the ideal gas law holds fugacity is equal to pressure The ratio for an ideal gas The fugacity by the following differential relation where is the fluid s volume For any two wikt isothermal isothermal physical states represented by subscripts and the ratio of the two fugacities is as follows physics stub
