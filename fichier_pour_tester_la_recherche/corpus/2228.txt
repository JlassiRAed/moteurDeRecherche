 Binary fission is a kind of asexual reproduction It is the most common form of reproduction in prokaryote s and occurs in some single celled eukaryotes like Amoeba In binary fission the fully grown parent cell splits into two halves producing two new cells After replication replicating its genetic material the cell divides into two nearly equal sized daughter cells The genetic material is also equally split The daughter cells are clone genetically identical File Binary Fission svg right center px Binary fission in a prokaryote The bacterium before binary fission is when the DNA is tightly coiled The DNA of the bacterium has replicated The DNA is pulled to the separate poles of the bacterium as it increases size to prepare for splitting The growth of a new cell wall begins to separate the bacterium The new cell wall fully develops resulting in the complete split of the bacterium The new daughter cells have tightly coiled DNA ribosomes and plasmids Some biologists use this term for multi cellular organisms that asexually reproduce by dividing into two other methods for exchanging DNA with each other During binary fission the DNA molecule divides and forms two DNA molecules Each molecule moves towards the opposite side of the bacterium At the same time the cell membrane divides to form daughter cells In the process of mitosis cell division takes place After division the new cells will grow and the process repeats itself
