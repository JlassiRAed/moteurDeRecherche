 Pseudogenes are gene s that have lost their function They have lost their gene expression in the Cell cell or their ability to code protein Pseudogenes can result from mutations in a gene whose product is not needed for the survival of the organism Although not protein coding the DNA of pseudogenes may be functional It may be similar to other kinds of non coding DNA which have a gene regulation regulatory role Most have some gene like features They lack protein coding ability resulting from a variety of disabling mutations or their inability to encode RNA Pseudogenes are generally thought of as the last stop for genomic material that is to be removed from the genome Zheng D et al Pseudogenes in the ENCODE regions Consensus annotation analysis of transcription and evolution Genome Res a pseudogene and its associated functional gene also share a common ancestor and have diverged as separate genetic entities over millions of years
