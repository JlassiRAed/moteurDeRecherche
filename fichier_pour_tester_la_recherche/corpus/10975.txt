 Apatite is a group of phosphate minerals with high concentrations of Hydroxide OH or ion s respectively in the crystal Apatite is characteristic of biological systems It is one of a few minerals produced and used by biological micro environmental systems It hardness defines on the Mohs scale of mineral hardness Mohs scale Hydroxyapatite is the main component of tooth enamel and bone mineral Much bone material is in a relatively rare form of apatite In this form most of the OH groups are absent and there are many carbonate and acid phosphate substitutions Fluorapatite
