A Lagrange point is a special type of place where the gravity is stable This is used with two objects in space where the smaller object orbits around the bigger one like the Earth and the Sun or the Moon and the Earth There are five places where a small object So a small satellite can stay in the Lagrange point without ever needing fuel to stay in orbit It is named after the mathematician Joseph Louis Lagrange who wrote a paper on this in Dust clouds and asteroid s can also stay in these points The five places are called L L L L and L The first three are called unstable because if a satellite gets a bit out of place it will fall away from that point and not come back without using fuel L and L are considered stable if a satellite gets a bit out of place it will be pulled back into place by the gravity and centripetal forces NASA has used the Lagrange points of the Sun Earth system to put satellites in orbit The L point from Earth Because L and L are stable they have attracted dust clouds and at least one asteroid These asteroids are called Trojan asteroid
