 Earthquake protector is a type of base isolation made to protect building and non building structure s against damage from strong earthquake s A building s seismic performance may be improved by reducing vibration s This may be done with damping mechanisms in vibration control technologies and especially in base isolation However for the very pliant systems such as base isolated structures with a relatively low bearing stiffness but with a high damping the so called damping force may turn out the main pushing force at a strong earthquake This finding created a theoretical ground in earthquake engineering for a damping disengaged base isolation technology called Earthquake protector
