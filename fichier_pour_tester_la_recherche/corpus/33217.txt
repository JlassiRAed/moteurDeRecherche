 The pupil is the opening in the centre of the eye Light enters through the pupil and goes through the lens lens which focus es the image on the retina The size of the pupil is controlled by muscle s There is a circular group which squeezes the iris smaller and another group which pulls the iris wider When more light is needed the pupil is made larger In brighter light the pupil is made smaller The pupil can be compared with the shutter shutter of a camera It is surrounded by the iris which is the coloured part of the eye The lens changes its shape depending on how far away the eye focuses The focus point is where the eye is focusing on The light makes the pupil change its size When it is darker the pupils will dilate to restrict the amount of light there is getting into the eye so we can see The pupil is normally black in most animals but in some reptiles it can be a different colour The main reason why we have a pupil is to regulate the light which travels to the retina The reason why it has no colour is because the light that travels through the pupil is absorbed by tissues at the inside of the eye In humans the pupil is round but in some other animals like cats it is shaped like a slit
