 Thermodynamic entropy is a Measurement measure of how organized or disorganized energy is present in a system of atom s or molecule s It is measured in joule s of energy per unit kelvin Entropy is an important part of the third law of thermodynamics Imagine that a group of molecules has ten units of energy If the energy in those molecules is perfectly organized then the molecules can do ten units of work However if the energy became less organized the molecules might only be able to do six units of work even though they still have ten units of energy in them When total entropy is reached there is no more energy to spend A good example of this is a cup of tea Now suppose your cup of tea is hot The tea has a lot of energy compared to the room the tea is in Over time the heat in the tea will spread into the room The tea will become colder This is because the energy in the tea escapes into the surrounding area Once the tea has gone cold there is no more heat that can be spread The tea has thus reached total entropy There are two types of rooms we recognize when we are talking about entropy An open system and a closed system The former means that energy can freely flow into and out of the room A closed system means that the room is closed off from the outside no energy can go in or out In the case of the tea the room was a closed system it had no means for energy to enter But we can also make it an open system by placing a stove in the room If we turn on the stove we can use the heat from the stove to reheat the cup of tea New usable energy has been brought into the environment The entropy has thus decreased The heat that went from the stove into the tea can then again escape into the room again until total entropy has been reached This is what the second law of thermodynamics describes A real life example of an open system is the Earth The surface gets a lot of energy from the Sun every day This allows plants to grow and water to stay liquid If we took away the Sun plants would die and water would freeze because the surface of our planet would be too cold
