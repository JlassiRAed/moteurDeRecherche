A multimeter or a multitester is an Electronics electronic measuring tool that is a combination of several tools in one unit It usually includes an ammeter voltmeter and ohmmeter Digital multimeters are sometimes called DMM too Modern multimeters can be used to measure electrical quantities other than electrical current current electrical resistance resistance and voltage For example they can be used to measure frequency capacitance transistor s Hfe and temperature The multimeter can make many tests so it is often called multitester When measuring resistance it acts as an ohmmeter showing ohm s For volt s it would be a Voltmeter Sometimes it is called a mixture of things like Volt ohm meter or VOM Most meters can measure volts amps and resistance
