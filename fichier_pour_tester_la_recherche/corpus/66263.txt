 Heat capacity is a measure of how much material materials can store up heat as they change temperature Materials with high heat capacities require a lot of heat to be stored up before a small change in temperature can be measure measured Materials with low heat capacities require very little heat to be stored up before a large change in temperature can be measured The heat capacity of one gram of a material is called the specific heat capacity of the material so that the heat capacity of something is its mass times its specific heat capacity Specific heat capacities are often listed in tables like this one
