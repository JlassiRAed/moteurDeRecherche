A spectrometer is an Optics optical instrument used to measure properties of light over a specific portion of the electromagnetic spectrum The independent variable is usually the wavelength of the light The variable measured is most often the light s intensity but could also for instance be the polarization state A spectrometer is used in spectroscopy for producing spectral line s and measuring their wavelength s and intensities Spectrometer is a term that is applied to instruments that operate over a very wide range of wavelengths from gamma ray s and X ray s into the far infrared In general any particular instrument will operate over a small portion of this total range because of the different techniques used to measure different portions of the spectrum Below optical frequencies the spectrum analyzer is a closely related electronic device
