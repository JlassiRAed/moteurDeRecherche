 Negative feedback is a basic concept of cybernetics it is the basis of regulation and control It is important in engineering and physiology In biology and physiology negative feedback is known as homeostasis Negative feedback occurs when the output of a system acts to oppose changes to the input of a system This has the result that the changes are made less and the system kept within limits The classic example is a central heating system which cuts off when a temperature sensor hits a pre set mark The negative feedback part is the thermostat
