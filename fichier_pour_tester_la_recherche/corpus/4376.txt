An ice core is a long piece of ice taken from a glacier The ice is drill ed very deep so that the ice core goes back to old ice at the bottom of the glacier Usually ice cores are taken from Antarctica Greenland or very high mountain s Snow falls on ground and accumulates because of the weight on top In the end only ice remains and all air goes away The deeper the ice the older it is Ice cores can be dated by looking at the layers often every season can be seen in the ice core because it forms a layer At other times it is more difficult to find out how old the ice is Other methods can be used like measuring conductivity or making mathematical model s Scientists study ice cores to find out how the climate was in the past The ice keeps information like gas es particles ash from volcano es The type of water that forms the ice can be used to calculate the temperature of Earth Ice cores help us know what the temperature was on the planet in the past thousand years We know more about ice age s that happen periodically This is a helpful addition to our knowledge about global warming
