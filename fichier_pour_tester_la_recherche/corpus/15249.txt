 Granite is a kind of igneous rock found on Earth but nowhere else in the Solar System It is formed from hot molten magma Its colour ranges from pink to grey according to the proportions of its minerals The magma is forced between other layers of rock by the pressure under the Earth s surface The magma cools and turns slowly into solid stone Granite has many different types of minerals in it These include quartz feldspar hornblende and sometimes mica As the magma cools these minerals form crystal s The crystals can be seen easily if the granite is cut and polished Granite is a common stone on Earth and makes up a big part of the Earth s crust crust It is usually found in the continental plate s of the Earth s crust Although it forms under the surface of the Earth there are many places where it has been forced upwards by Plate tectonics tectonic movement When plates in the Earth s crust move together they get bent and pushed upwards When this happens granite mountain s can be formed
