An ion is an electric charge electrically charged atom or group of atoms It is a part of an atom or part of a group of atoms oppositely charged electron s An ion has unequal numbers of protons and electrons Making an ion from an atom or molecule is called ionization The charge on a proton is measured as a negatively charged electron A liquid with ions is called an electrolyte A gas with lots of ions is called a plasma plasma When ions move it is called electricity For example in a wire the metal ions do not move but the electrons move as electricity A positive ion and a negative ion will move together Two ions of the same charge will move apart When ions move they also make magnetic field s
