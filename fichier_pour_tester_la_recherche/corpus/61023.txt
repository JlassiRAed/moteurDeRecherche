 Tidal energy sometimes called tidal power is the power achieved by capturing the energy contained in moving water in tide s and open ocean Ocean current currents There are two types of tidal energy systems that can be used to extract energy kinetic energy the moving water of rivers tides and open ocean currents and potential energy from the difference in height energy Like other hydroelectricity tidal power is classified as a renewable energy source because tide s are caused by the orbital mechanics of the solar system In Europe tide mill s have been used for nearly years mainly for Gristmill grinding grains Modern tide mills provide tidal stream power
