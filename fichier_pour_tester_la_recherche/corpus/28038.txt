 Mathematical induction is a special way of proving a mathematical truth It can be used to prove that something is true for all the natural numbers The idea is that thenIn the careful language of mathematics Because it s true for then it is true for and so on An example of proof by induction Prove that for all natural numbers n Proof First the statement can be written for all natural numbers n By induction on n First for n so this is true Next assume that for some n n the statement is true That is Then for n n can be rewritten Since Hence the proof is correct
