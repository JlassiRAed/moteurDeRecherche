The Simple Stub Project is essentially a project to determine when a new WP Stub stub should be created Initially only very few stub types should be created for common topics such as writers actors bio s etcetera Only when a particular category has exceeded in maintaining an appropriate level of articles will new stub types be created Articles should only temporarily sit in the category of for a brief period of time Further categorization is needed to locate the stubs you prefer to expand Locating these easily will be a benefit to this project
