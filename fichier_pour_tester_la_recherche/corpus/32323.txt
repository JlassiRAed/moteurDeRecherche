 Factorization is taking a composite number apart into numbers that multiply together to get the original number These smaller numbers are called factors or divisor s is a factor of all numbers Prime factorization is breaking apart a composite numbers into prime number s that can be multiplied to give the larger number Note that since is not prime it is not included in the prime factorization For example can be factorized as times Since is not a prime number that is not its prime factorization s prime factorization is in fact times times The numbers which are obtained from the factorization are usually ordered for example starting with the smallest number For example The factorization of every number is wikt unique unique This generalizes to Every number has a unique prime factorization Every prime factorization corresponds to a unique numberSince finding the numbers to multiply together is very difficult for large numbers this fact can be used in cryptography
