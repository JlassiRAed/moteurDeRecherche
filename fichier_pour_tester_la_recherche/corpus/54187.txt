An enol is an alkene that has an OH group attached to one end of the double bond It is called an enolate if the proton on the oxygen atom is taken away Enols are tautomer s of ketone s or aldehyde s Tautomers are molecule s which are different only in the position of an hydrogen atom Enols can be made very easily from ketones or aldehydes using a base base They are quite unstable because the C O bond is stronger than the C C bond However they can do many interesting chemical reaction reactions The best example is the aldol reaction Enols of ketones can be made on two different sides It is important to be able to choose which side to react The side with less substituents is the easiest one to react it can be made at low temperature with a Steric effects bulky base This is called the kinetic enolate The other side with more substituents is more difficult to react Higher temperatures are needed This is called the thermodynamic enolate
