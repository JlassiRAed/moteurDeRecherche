 Behavioral economics is a smaller part of economics that combines what we know about psychology with what we know about economics Normally economics does not consider the way humans actually think but instead simplifies decision making to make economic models easier to understand However this is not a complete picture of how the world and economics really works Normally economists assume people are rational meaning they make good decisions at the right times using all information In real life people do not do this They are subject to problems with self control problems with time and make different choices depending on how decisions are presented to them
