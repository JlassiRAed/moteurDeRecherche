Less than two months after the launch of the Simple English Wikipedia s Did You Know section another new project has been launched The Simple English Wikipedia Wikicup The aim of the Wikicup is to make editing more fun and also reward editors for their time dedicated to building the encyclopedia for the benefit of others The idea for the cup was first throught up by User Shapiros Shapiros in September but unfortunately it was underused and underdeveloped before eventually being cancelled But it was not forgotten User Yotcmdr Yotcmdr retained their interest in the idea and in Decemeber it was re launched with his own ideas and also included the new Wikipedia Did you know DYK section that was omitted from the initial version as it had not yet been created The idea grew in popularity and soon had the backing from User Gwib Gwib and User Bluegoblin Bluegoblin as judges of the cup Bluegoblin also redesigned the project page and helped to mastermind it s move into the Wikipedia namespace as well as it s advertising around the Simple English Wikipedia It now has competitors and we watch with interest how these users are split up when the pools are released at the end of December We also watch with more interest what happens once the Cup begins Good luck to everyone competing and if you haven t yet WP WC Competitors for the WikiCup signed up then why not Finally I hope that everyone has a good Christmas and New Year and that you all have a good Christmas break December Related Links and Articles Wikipedia Wikicup Wikipedia talk Wikicup Wikipedia Wikicup
