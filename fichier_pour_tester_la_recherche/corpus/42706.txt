 Genetic linkage occurs when allele s at different Locus loci do not segregate at random Gregor Mendel Mendel s second law is thus broken Genes are linked when they are on the same chromosome They then tend to stay together during meiosis Alleles for genes on different chromosomes are usually not linked due to independent assortment of chromosomes during meiosis There is some crossing over of DNA during meiosis when the chromosomes segregate So alleles on the same chromosome can be separated and go to different daughter cells There is a greater probability of this happening if the alleles are far apart on the chromosome as it is more likely that a cross over will occur between them The relative distance between two genes can be calculated using the offspring of an organism showing two linked genetic traits The percentage of offspring where the two traits do not run together is noted The higher the percentage of offspring showing both traits the closer on the chromosome the two genes are This was the first technique used for mapping genes on chromosomes By working out the number of recombinants it is possible to obtain a measure for the distance between the genes This distance is called a genetic map unit of is equivalent to m u A linkage map is created by finding the map distances between a number of traits that are present on the same chromosome ideally avoiding significant gaps between traits to avoid the possibility of multiple crossovers
