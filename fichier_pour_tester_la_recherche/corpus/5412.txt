 Docodonts are an order order or suborder of extinct Mammaliaformes mammaliaforms They lived during the mid to late Mesozoic era They had sophisticated molars from which the suborder gets its name In the fossil record isolated teeth and bits of jawbones are found Docodonts are not quite as closely related to the placental s and marsupial s as the monotreme s are so they are not included among the Crown group Because of their molars and their lower jaw being a single bone crown group exclude docodonts They use the term mammaliaformes instead Docodonts were primarily Herbivore herbivorous or Insectivore insectivorous However Castorocauda adapted to a semi aquatic life has teeth which suggest it ate fish Castorocauda is important because the first find was an almost complete skeleton It breaks the small nocturnal insectivore stereotype It was noticeably larger than most Mesozoic mammaliaform fossils and gives absolutely certain evidence of hair and fur Of course this strongly suggests mammalian type temperature regulation
