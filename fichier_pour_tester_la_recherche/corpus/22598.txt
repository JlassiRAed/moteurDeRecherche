The Lepidoptera are the butterfly butterflies and moth s However though the butterflies are a natural monophyletic group moths are not Butterflies are often put in the suborder Rhopalocera which includes Papilionoidea In Linnaean taxonomy moths are usually put in the suborder Heterocera This tends to cover up the fact that they are not a true natural monophyletic group However moths do look and behave rather different from butterflies which explains why people came to call them by a different name Other taxonomic schemes have been proposed but none of them is perfect Both taxonomy taxonomists and amateurs make use of the obvious differences between butterflies and moths
