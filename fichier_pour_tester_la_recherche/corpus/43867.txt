 WP AutoEd AutoEd was designed with a high level of customizability in mind which allows it to be greatly altered by each person who wants to use it and it can even support the creation of new modules which effectively create entirely new user scripts This page will serve to document how you can customize and change AutoEd to fit your personal tastes and preferences and how to create new modules A knowledge of JavaScript may be helpful for more advanced customization but shouldn t be required once the basic use and creation of regular expressions is documented here This page is not yet complete but all information that is on it should be accurate
