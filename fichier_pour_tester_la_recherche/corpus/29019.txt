 George Ledyard Stebbins Jr was an Americans American botany botanist and genetics geneticist He was one of the leading evolutionary biology evolutionary biologists of the th century Stebbins received his PhD in botany from Harvard University in He went on to the University of California Berkeley where his work led to a synthesis of plant evolution and genetics His most important publication was Variation and evolution in plants which combined genetics and Charles Darwin Darwin s theory of natural selection to describe plant speciation It helped form the modern evolutionary synthesis and still provides the framework for research in plant evolutionary biology According to Ernst Mayr Few later works dealing with the evolutionary systematics of plants have not been very deeply affected by Stebbins work More than anything else it was Stebbins book Variation and evolution in plants that brought botany into the synthesis It had the same impact in botany as Theodosius Dobzhansky Dobzhansky s book in population genetics integrating the widely scattered literature of plant evolution and providing abundant suggestions for further research He also researched and wrote widely on the role of hybrid ization and polyploidy in speciation and plant evolution his work in this area has had a lasting influence on research in the field Stebbins was elected to the National Academy of Science was awarded the National Medal of Science He was involved in the development of evolution based science programs for California high schools as well as the conservation of rare plants in that state
