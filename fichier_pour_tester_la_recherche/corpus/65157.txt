 Metallic hydrogen is an alkali metal made from hydrogen gas This is formed when the hydrogen gas is under compression and results with the gas changing phases of matter phase It is an example of degenerate matter The matter has a crystal structure of proton atoms with spacing that is extremely small smaller than a Bohr radius The electron s in the molecular orbital are unbounded and they behave like the electrical conductor conduction electrons in a metal Metallic hydrogen is unusual as the element itself is not an alkali metal but a diatomic gas Metallic hydrogen is known to exist in the planetary core cores of Jupiter Saturn Jupiter has the most metallic hydrogen
