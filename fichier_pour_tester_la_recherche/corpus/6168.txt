 Erosion is a process where natural forces like water wind ice and gravity wear away rocks and soil It is a geological process and part of the rock cycle Erosion occurs at the Earth s surface and has no effect on the Earth s mantle and Earth s core core Most of the energy that makes erosion happen is provided by the Sun The Sun s energy causes the movement of water and ice in the water cycle and the movement of air to create wind Erosion can cause problems that affect humans Soil erosion for example can create problems for farmers Soil erosion can remove soil leaving a thin layer or rocky soil behind Erosion can also cause problems for humans by removing rocks or soil that support buildings
