 Flotation is a process where gas bubble s are injected at the bottom of a tank containing a mixture of a liquid and solid particles to separate the solid particles from the liquid When the gas bubbles move along the liquid mixture the solids particles stick to the surface of the bubbles The bubbles form a foam at the surface of the liquid this foam contains the solid particles so after the flotation process the solids can be removed just cleaning the liquid from this foam
