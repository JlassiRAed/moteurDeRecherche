 Anaerobic respiration is a form of respiration which does not use oxygen Elements other than oxygen are used for electron transport Common replacements for oxygen are nitrate s iron manganese sulfate s sulfur fumaric acid and carbon dioxide Escherichia coli uses nitrates and fumaric acid for respiration For the electron transport chain to work there must be a final electron acceptor at the end of the chain Anaerobic respiration is therefore less efficient than aerobic respiration except of course when oxygen pressure is low If oxygen is not used at all the process is called fermentation Examples of organism s using fermentation are lactic acid bacteria and yeast Yeast is a fungi not bacteria The equation for anaerobic respiration is glucose lactic acid
