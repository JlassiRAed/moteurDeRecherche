In physics mechanical energy describes the potential energy and kinetic energy present in the components of a mechanical system When a given amount of mechanical energy is transferred whereas mechanical work describes the amount of mechanical energy a component has gained or lost The conservation of mechanical energy is a principle which states that under certain conditions the total mechanical energy of a system is constant This rule does not hold when mechanical energy is converted to other forms such as chemical nuclear or electromagnetic However the principle of general conservation of energy is so far an unbroken rule of physics as far as we know energy cannot be created or destroyed only changed in form
