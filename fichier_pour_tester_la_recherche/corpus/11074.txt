The word amplifier louder and stronger Amplifiers are also hidden in any electronic thing that makes sound with loudspeakers This includes televisions radios computers and mp players to name a few Devices similar to the electronic amplifier are made in mechanical engineering The power assisted steering and braking on a motor car utilise mechanical amplifiers to multiply the amount of force applied by the driver Amplifiers ability to use low impedance speakers may vary Typical impedance is ohms Classification can be done by current loss when amplifier is on but does not get signal Example A class amplifier takes more current without signal than B class amplifier but A class amplifier have smaller distortion There is also several distortion types
