 Biometrics is a field of study which aims to identify or recognise people based on Trait trait s they have Given these traits a system can be training trained to recognise certain people with a certain probability Better training usually lowers the probability of falsely identifying someone The traits used are of two types Based on the shape of the body or retina Based on the behaviour of a person Most often the two types are combined as in voice recognition voice or signature recognition Most of these biometrics are seen as behavioral but some are linked to the physiology e g of the vocal tract or of the hand A person may be identified by a fingerprint or by letting the person signature sign a wikt document document The data could then be kept Someone who is checking can again take the fingerprint or the signature and compare it to the old version When selecting features those choosing must also look at social acceptance Taking a fingerprint may be ok taking a blood test may not be Some biometric data is also easier to fake e g signature s Also when voice samples are taken these may be distorted because only a telephone telephone line is available Telephone lines cut off some bandwidth from the signal Other than for passports biometric methods are also used in some banks
