 Monophyly means common descent from a single ancestor Biologist s have introduced a kind of taxonomy called cladistics The aim of this is to make biological classification fit what we know about the way organisms evolution evolved If there is a group made of a common ancestor and all its descendants that group is monophyletic A group which contains organisms without their common ancestor is called polyphyletic If a group contains the common ancestor but leaves out some of its descendants it is called paraphyletic All living things on this planet are thought on the basis of DNA analysis to be monophyletic that is to have one origin not many In phylogenetics a group is monophyletic if it consists of an inferred common ancestor and all its descendants A taxonomic group that contains organisms but not their common ancestor is called polyphyletic and a group that contains some but not all descendants of the most recent common ancestor is called paraphyletic Example all species in the genus Homo Homo have come from the same ancestral form in the family Hominidae and no other descendants are known Thus the genus Homo is monophyletic If on the other hand it were discovered that Homo habilis had developed from a different ancestor from Homo sapiens and this ancestor were not included in the genus then the genus would be polyphyletic Since biologist s by and large tend to prefer monophyletic groups in this case they would likely either split the genus or broaden it to include the additional forms Example of polyphyletic group Sea slug s
