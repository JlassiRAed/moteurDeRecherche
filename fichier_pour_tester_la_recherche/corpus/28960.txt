 Annealing is the name for a number of processes that change the properties of a piece of work using heat In general the piece is heated to a certain temperature and modelled while it cools off Specifically annealing can refer to Annealing when metal metals are treated Annealing stress Nucleic acid thermodynamics when DNA like structures are changed Simulated annealing is a method of combinatorial optimization to find the wikt optimum optimum of a function function Quantum annealing is another method of combinatorial optimization disambiguation
