 file DNA polymerase png thumb right px D structure of part of human DNA polymerase beta A DNA polymerase is an enzyme which makes DNA molecules from its nucleotide building blocks DNA polymerases are essential for DNA replication They usually work in pairs as they copy one double stranded DNA molecule into two double stranded DNAs In DNA replication DNA polymerase reads a piece of DNA that s already there and uses it to make a new piece that is exactly the same as the old piece DNA polymerases also play key roles in other processes within cells including DNA repair genetic recombination Retrovirus reverse transcription and antibody production DNA polymerases are widely used in molecular biology laboratories notably for the polymerase chain reaction DNA sequencing and molecular cloning DNA polymerase can only connect deoxyribonucleotide s to a OH group that is already there so DNA is always made in the direction
