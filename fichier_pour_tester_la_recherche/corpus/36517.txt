A cryptographic protocol protocol that performs a information security security related function and applies cryptography cryptographic methods A protocol describes how the cryptography cryptographic algorithm s should be used to information security secure information The description of a protocol must include details about all data structure s and representations and all details about how to utilize the protocol by computer program programs Cryptographic protocols are widely used for Security secure application level Data transmission data transport in order to Security secure transferred messages A cryptographic protocol usually has at least some of these features The Technical terminology term cryptographic protocol is used in different ways For example cryptographic application protocols often use one or more underlying Key agreement protocol s which are also sometimes themselves referred to as cryptographic protocols like the Secure Sockets Layer which uses what is known as the Diffie Hellman key exchange Diffie Hellman may be seen as a complete cryptographic protocol in itself for other applications
