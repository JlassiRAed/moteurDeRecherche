 Wikia is a website where people can make a wiki Wikia was started in by Jimmy Wales and Angela Beesley It used to be called Wikicities and the name was changed to Wikia on March to prevent other people from mistaking it for a wiki on cities Wikis on Wikia must be about something which lots of people will like so people cannot make them on any topic All content on Wikia is released under a free license such as the GNU Free Documentation License or the Creative Commons Anybody can change pages on wikis at Wikia so that no single person owns or is the boss of a wiki and so that large Community communities can be made The software used is MediaWiki Wikia uses advertisement s to generate money which is different than Wikipedia which uses donation s In general Wikia has much lower standards of notability than Wikipedia does This means that something can have an article on Wikia but not on Wikipedia Also articles on Wikia are often written in more in universe style meaning that fictional character s and plots are written as if they are real Some projects on Wikia are more for people who are very interested in the topic In August they said that a new look was coming making some people take their wikis off the service Like Wikipedia Wikia uses the MediaWiki software
