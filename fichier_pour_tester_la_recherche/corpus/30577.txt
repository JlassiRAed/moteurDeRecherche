In molecular biology transformation is the genetic alteration of a cell cell by the direct uptake and Gene expression expression of DNA from its surroundings Transformation occurs naturally in some species of bacteria and can also be done artificially Bacteria that are capable of being transformed whether naturally or artificially are called competent Transformation is one of three processes by which outside genetic material may be got into bacterial cells The other two are bacterial conjugation conjugation Transformation may also used to describe the insertion of new genetic material into nonbacterial cells such as animal and plant cells Introduction of foreign DNA into eukaryote cells is usually called transfection
