The crossbills are a genus Loxia of birds in the finch family species These birds have mandibles with crossed tips which gives the group its English language English name The wonderful world of bird beaks BBC Earth Adult males tend to be red or orange in colour and females green or yellow but there is much variation Crossbills are specialist feeders on conifer cone s The unusual bill shape is an adaptation to get seeds from cones These birds are typically found in higher northern hemisphere latitudes where their food sources grow They move out of the breeding range if the cone crop fails Crossbills breed very early in the year often in winter months This is the time to get the most cones They put their beak slightly open between the scales of conifer cones Then they close their beaks and the tips push the scales apart This lets them get at the seed The point is that as cones mature they tend to open when dry and close when wet Eventually they fall and lie on the ground As they dry the scales naturally open and any animal can get at the seeds With their beaks crossbills can get at the seeds much earlier than any other animal
