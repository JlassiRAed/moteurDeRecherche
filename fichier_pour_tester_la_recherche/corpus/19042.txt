In rhetoric a tautology is an argument or proposition which is self proving The claim as stated is logically irrefutable This hides the lack of evidence or valid reasoning supporting the conclusion In effect the meaning is repeated usually in terms which appear to be different It is not just repetition Basically it is saying the same thing twice but you might say it using different words i e You might say We are reversing backwards This is tautology because you have already said that you are moving backwards but it has been repeated possibly as a mistake or for emphasis Sometimes the tautology is not easy to see
