 New Zealand sits on top of the junction of two oceanic plates Orogeny is the process of mountain building It takes place when two tectonic plate s come together Orogens develop while a continental plate is crumpled and thickened to form mountain range s and involve a great range of geological processes collectively called orogenesis Examples Where a continent rides over an oceanic plate Where two continental plates converge Another less common cause is when a plate moves over a Hotspot mantle Examples Hawaii an chain of islands Yellowstone National Park There is a third process called delamination Here an unstable portion of cold root of the lithosphere drips down into the mantle decreasing the density of the lithosphere and causing buoyant uplift Example Areas that are Rift rift ing apart such as mid ocean ridge s and the East African Rift have mountains due to thermal buoyancy caused by the hot mantle underneath them which pushes them up This thermal buoyancy is known as dynamic topography Examples
