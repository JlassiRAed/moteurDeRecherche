 Implication and inference are two related words which are opposite s To imply is to suggest something is true without actually saying it Examples Your former wife suggests you did have a wife to whom you are no longer married Have you stopped beating your wife suggests not only that you have a wife but that you have been in the habit of beating her To infer is to see the implication in the sentence When you realise the meaning of the second sentence and protest I have never beaten her you have made an inference Here are the rule s The person who makes the suggestion implies it The person who recognises the suggestion infers it Inference always comes after an implication I imply then you infer An implication is always verbal but inferring is not always verbal A non verbal response might show the indirect message by the receiver Example I hate you may contain unspoken implications according to circumstance and tone of voice Between two lovers it might mean Bitter feelings after a quarrel This is the literal meaning and not an implication A statement of love Response might be I love you too
