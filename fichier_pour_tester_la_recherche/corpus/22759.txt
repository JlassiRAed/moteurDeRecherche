 Adsorption is the sticking of atom s or molecule s to a surface The particles which get stuck on can be from a gas liquid or a solution dissolved solid An example would be the way water sticks to the surface of sand grains on a beach or to particles of soil The exact nature of the force which holds them on varies according to the nature of the surface and the adsorbed molecules The force may be a weak physics physical force or weak chemical bond s but strong enough to keep the layer of molecules stuck on Supplying more heat usually breaks the bonds and causes the adsorbed molecules to evaporate Only free water can Evaporation evaporate
