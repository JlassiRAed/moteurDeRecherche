The sine rule or law of sines is a theorem in mathematics It says that if you have a triangle like the one in the picture the equation below is true This is another version which is also true D is equal to the diameter of the triangle s circumcircle The law of sines is used to find the remaining sides of a triangle when two angles and a side are known This is known as triangulation However this calculation can have a numerical error if an angle is close to degrees The law of sines can also be used when two sides and one of the angles not enclosed by the two sides are known In some such cases the formula gives two possible values for the enclosed angle This is called an ambiguous case The law of sines is one of two trigonometric equations which is used to find lengths and angles in scalene triangles The other is the law of cosines
