In physics intensity can usually be understood as the strength of something like a beam of light To figure out the exact intensity of a beam of light or a fire hose spraying water we need to know how many units of light or water are coming to some area in some period of time A factory might have an intensity of cars per day delivered to the loading dock A fire hose might have an intensity of buckets of water per minute per open window of a certain size in a burning building Usually when talking about intensity we are talking about the amount or energy of particles or radiation per unit area Since each particle spreads out from the source in a sphere the area is measured as the surface area of this sphere or pi r where r is the distance from the source to the observer
