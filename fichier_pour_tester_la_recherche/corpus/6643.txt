In cryptography a shared secret is a piece of data only known to the parties involved in a secure communication The shared secret can be a password a passphrase a big number or an array of randomly chosen bytes The shared secret is either shared before parties start to communicate in this case it can also be called a pre shared key Or it is created at the start of the communication session by using a key agreement protocol for instance using public key cryptography such as Diffie Hellman key exchange Diffie Hellman or using symmetric key algorithm symmetric key cryptography such as Kerberos Kerberos The shared secret can be used for authentication keys to use for encryption and or Message authentication code MACing of messages To make unique Session key session and message keys the shared secret is usually combined with an initialization vector An example of this is the derived unique key per transaction method
