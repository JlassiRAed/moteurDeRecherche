A transistor is an electronic component that can be used as an amplifier or as a switch It is made of semiconductor material Transistors are found in most electronics electronic devices A transistor has three connectors or Electronic component terminals In the older bipolar transistor they are the collector the emitter and the base The flow of charge goes in the collector and out of the emitter depending on the charge flowing to the base In this way it is possible for the base to switch on or off the flow through the transistor A MOSFET names its terminals differently because it works differently The transistor can be used for a variety of different things including amplifiers and digital switches for computer microprocessor s Digital work mostly uses MOSFET s Some transistors are individually packaged mainly so they can handle high power Most are inside integrated circuit s
