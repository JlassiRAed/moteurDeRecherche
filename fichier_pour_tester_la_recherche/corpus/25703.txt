A dive bomber is a bomber aircraft that wikt dive dives towards the ground so it can get very close to its wikt target targets so that it is more likely to hit them This can also limit the chance of Anti aircraft warfare anti aircraft fire hitting the plane Diving nearly vertical ly at the target the aircraft will release the bombs very close to the target at high speed This allows a dive bomber to drop bombs accurately on a relatively small target or a moving target quite easily Dive bombers were widely used to attack high value targets such as ship s and bridge s This also had the advantage of attacking ship s at a weak spot A ship s armour was heaviest near the water On the top of the ship however the armour was very thin or there was no armour at all Also dive bombing allowed relatively small aeroplanes carrying a limited bomb load to do more damage than usual Because of better bombsights and better anti aircraft warfare after World War II dive bombers were replaced by attack aircraft
