 Neognaths are birds in the subclass Neornithes The Neognathae include almost all living birds their sister taxon Palaeognathae has just the tinamou and the flightless ratite s There are nearly species of neognaths Since the Cretaceous they have undergone an adaptive radiation This has produced the variety of form function and behavior which we see today The Passerine bird Passeriformes are the largest order of land vertebrates They are some of living birds The neognaths have fused metacarpus hand bones an elongate third finger and or fewer vertebrae They differ from the Palaeognathae in features like the structure of their jawbones Neognathae means new jaws but ironically paleognath jaws are one of the few derived features of that group
