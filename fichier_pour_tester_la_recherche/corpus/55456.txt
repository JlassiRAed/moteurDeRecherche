 Neurospora is a genus of Ascomycete fungi The best known species in this genus is Neurospora crassa a common model organism in genetics and molecular biology The first published account of this fungus was from an infestation of French bakeries in Davis and Perkins Neurospora a model of model microbes Nature Reviews Genetics pp N crassa is used as a model organism because it is easy to grow and has a haploid life cycle that makes genetics genetic analysis simple since recessive traits will show up in the offspring Analysis of genetic recombination is facilitated by the ordered arrangement of the products of meiosis in Neurospora ascospores Its entire genome of seven chromosome s has been sequenced Neurospora was used by Edward Tatum and George Wells Beadle in their experiments for which they won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in Beadle and Tatum exposed N crassa to x rays causing mutations They then observed failures in metabolic pathway s caused by errors in specific enzyme s This led them to propose the one gene one enzyme hypothesis that specific gene s code for specific protein s Their hypothesis was later elaborated to enzyme pathways by Norman Horowitz Norman Horowitz also working on Neurospora In the April issue of Nature the genome of N crassa was reported as completely DNA sequencing sequenced In its natural environment N crassa lives mainly in tropical and sub tropical regions It can be found growing on dead plant matter after fires Neurospora is actively used in research around the world It is important in the elucidation of molecular events involved in circadian rhythms epigenetics and gene silencing cell polarity cell fusion development as well as many aspects of cell biology and biochemistry Strains and other materials for working with Neurospora are available from the Fungal Genetics Stock Center
