 Phenomenology is a way of thinking about ourselves Instead of asking about what we really are it focuses on phenomena These are experiences that we get from the senses what we see taste smell touch hear and emotion feel Phenomenology does not ask if what we are seeing is actually there for example it is not where we see an object either in real life a dream or a hallucination that is important but it is the significance of the object that is important to the phenomenologist It also does not ask if we are missing something or if we have all the facts Instead phenomenologists believe we should look at the world just as it appears to us Martin Heidegger a famous phenomenologist said that philosophers should be looking at how we live in our average everydayness
