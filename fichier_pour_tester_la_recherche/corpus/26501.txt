In economics price control is the idea that the government fixes the price s that can be charged for a given Product product or service in a given market The government either fixes an absolute price that is charged or a price range with a minimum and a maxium Usually this is done so that goods such as staple food remain affordable It can also be done to avoid people charging way too much for a good or service which is known as price gouging Another field where it is done is to ensure a minimum wage or salary that employers must pay The problem with the approach is that according to the Law of Supply and Demand the price of a good or service depends on its supply compared with the demand for it If the price is fixed below the price the market would normally ask the demand will increase the product is cheaper than it should be In general the supply is fixed at some point it is not possible to increase the production and the supply In the long term it will therefore not be possible to meet the demand and there will be a wikt shortage shortage In the th century BC Lactantius wrote that Diocletian by various taxes he had made all things exceedingly expensive attempted by a law to limit their prices Then much blood of merchants was shed for trifles men were afraid to offer anything for sale and the wikt scarcity scarcity became more excessive and grievous than ever Until in the end the price limit law after having proved destructive to many people was from mere necessity abolished The world oil market chronology Arab oil embargo between October and March is another example on how price controls cause shortages Long lines of cars and trucks quickly appeared at retail Petrol station gas stations in the U S and some stations closed because of a shortage of fuel at the low price set by the U S Cost of Living Council The fixed price was below what the market would otherwise pay and as a result the inventory disappeared It made no difference whether prices were voluntarily or involuntarily posted below the market clearing price wikt scarcity Scarcity resulted in either case Price controls fail to achieve their wikt proximate proximate aim which is to reduce prices paid by retail consumers but such controls do manage to reduce supply When price controls on gasoline were lifted the shortage ended and the long lines of cars at gas pumps disappeared Nobel Prize in Economics Nobel prize winner Milton Friedman said We economists don t know much but we do know how to create a shortage If you want to create a shortage of tomato es for example just pass a law that retailer s can t sell tomatoes for more than two cents per Pound pound Instantly you ll have a tomato shortage It s the same with crude oil oil or gas
