 Murray Gell Mann is an American physicist who received the Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on the theory of particle physics elementary particles Gell Mann has also worked at CERN as a John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation Fellow in He is known for his study of particle physics the smallest parts that make up the universe These small particles behaved in ways that did not appear to follow the known laws of physics and Gell Mann came up with the idea of giving them a strangeness number which could allow them to be compared and put into categories He also came up with idea that parts of an atom the proton ad the neutron were made up of even smaller particles He called the quarks a nonsense work from James Joyce s book Finnigan s Wake Gell Mann then developed the idea that quarks were held together inside the nucleus by a force he called color and this force could be given a quantum number
