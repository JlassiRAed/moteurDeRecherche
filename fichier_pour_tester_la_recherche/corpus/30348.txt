 Kenneth Poppi Freeman claimed later that Freeman personally confessed to him as being armed and shooting Faulkner Arnold Beverly in an affidavit where he wikt confess confessed to the murder named another guy as a shooter Some witnesses testified that they saw a man with a green army jacket going away from the crime scene Billy Cook said that Kenneth Freeman was wearing a green army jacket Freeman was reportedly in Germany in the Army and usually wore the jacket One important contradiction is the fact that Cynthia White picked Freeman out of a lineup as the killer but later changed her testimony to fit the prosecution s story This can be explained by her admission that police bribed her to do so so that she could legally work as a prostitution prostitute That leads to another important inconsistency which is that Yvette Williams someone who White knew personally said that White told her that she did not see the actual killer which means it was not possible for her to identify Freeman as the killer unless he confessed to her personally On May Kenneth Freeman was found dead in an empty area handcuffed bound and naked his death listed as natural causes J Patrick O Connor in his book The Framing of Mumia Abu Jamal says that h is body was found bound gagged and naked in a vacant lot
