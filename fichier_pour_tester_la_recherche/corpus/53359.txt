In botany a stoma is a tiny opening or pore that is used for gas exchange They are mostly found on the under surface of plant leaf leaves Swarthout Debbie and Hogan C Michael Stomata Encyclopedia of Earth National Council for Science and the Environment Washington DC Air enters the plant through these openings Plant open these stomata during external or we can say aerobic respiration The carbon dioxide is used in photosynthesis Some of the oxygen produced is used in Cellular respiration respiration Surplus oxygen exits through these same openings Also water vapor goes into the atmosphere through these pores in a process called transpiration The pore is formed by a pair of cells known as guard cells These adjust the size of the opening by opening or closing Plants lose water through stomata Guard cells are able to open and close the stomata to save water Plants also open their guard cells to bring carbon dioxide into the leaf To open a guard cell proton s are pumped into the guard cells and water follows since the water potential inside the guard cell is lower When water follows the cells get hard and they push open The stomata helps the plant to take in carbon dioxide and give out oxygen It also helps in the process of transpiration It contains chloroplasts and epidermal cell on them
