The modern Greek alphabet has letters It is used to write the Greek language The Greek alphabet is thought to be where all important European alphabets came from Although the alphabet was borrowed from the Phoenician alphabet around the th century BC there were many changes made to make it fit the Greek language The main change was that some of the Phoenician letters that were for sounds not used in Greek were turned into vowel s The Phoenicians had written their alphabet without any vowels so this change made writing a lot easier to read This change was also better fit for Indo European languages which did not use consonant based roots like those in Semitic languages such as Phoenician Arabic language Arabic Hebrew language Hebrew and Aramaic language Aramaic Another change is that some new letters were invented for sounds that were in Greek but not in the Phoenician language At first Greek was written from right to left the same as Phoenician but after the th century BC it was written from left to right There were some differences in the early Greek alphabet depending on what part of the Greek world it was used in The two main kinds were the eastern and western ones But over time all Greeks started to use the same alphabet especially after the Ionic alphabet of Miletus was officially adopted in Athens in BC A little later the rest of Greece did the same and by BC during the rule of Alexander the Great almost all Greeks were using the same twenty four letter Greek alphabet Later Aristophanes of Byzantium pitch of Greek words Although the Greek letters accurately represented all the main sounds of the Greek language early on the sounds of the Greek language changed over time Some of the vowel sounds began to sound similar to one another aspirated Voiceless sound voiceless Stop consonant stops became Voiceless sound voiceless Fricative consonant fricatives and Voiced consonant voiced Stop consonant stops became Voiced consonant voiced Fricative consonant fricatives One can get an idea of how older Greek pronunciations sounded by looking at the Latin and English spellings of Greek loanwords like philosopher Chimera Cyprus and Thessalonica
