The glass transition is the wikt transition transition of amorphous solid s from a hard and brittle Status state into a molten or rubber like state An amorphous solid that goes through a glass transition is called a glass Supercooling a viscous liquid into the glass state is called vitrification The glass transition temperature T of the crystalline state of the material if one exists Above a glass transition temperature a plastic is rubber y Below the glass transition temperature a plastic is solid Thermoset s or thermo setting plastics burn up before they reach their melt temperature but most thermosets also undergo glass transition
