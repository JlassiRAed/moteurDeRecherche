 Animal colour is produced by light reflecting from an animal s surface The ways animals produce colours include pigment s chromatophore s and other structure s and bioluminescence Since sight is usually so important to animals and is so often used by predator s as a long range way to find prey an animal s colour must serve one or more functions These functions such as finding prey or evading capture or finding a mate are absolutely essential for life and survival Therefore animal colour is determined by natural selection because it affects the wikt survival survival of animals and their wikt offspring offspring Some of the most obvious functions of colour are Camouflage enabling an animal to remain hidden from view Signalling to other animals Warning colouration signalling to other animals not to attack Mimicry taking advantage of another species warning coloration Sexual selection finding a mate Other kinds of signalling Diversion Deimatic defence Startle defence unexpected flashes of colour or eyespots wikt dazzle Dazzle confusing a predator by moving a bold pattern rapidly Physical protection such as humans in tropical climate s have dark skin pigments which protect against sunburn and skin cancer Incidental colouration This is common in plants which have green leaves because chlorophyll is green In animals it is rare such as having red blood However when the red shows on the surface it is often due to selection as in human red lips Overwhelmingly the most common function of colour is in predator prey relationships Anti predator adaptation s occur in every biome of the world and in almost every taxonomic group Animal colour has been a topic of interest and research in biology for a long time According to Charles Darwin s theory of natural selection
