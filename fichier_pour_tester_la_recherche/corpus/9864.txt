A cathode is a type of electrode through which electron s move Electrodes are an electrical conductor This lets an electrical current go into an electrical device such as a battery It can also end in a vacuum like in a cathode ray tube In this case the electrons may go into open space In other words a cathode is a positive electrode on a battery and a negative electrode on an electrolytic cell Electric current is perceived as flowing in the opposite direction that the electrons are flowing So electrons go into the terminal of a battery but electric current goes out Electrons go into the terminal of an electrolytic cell but electric current goes out An electrode through which electrons flows out of the device is termed an anode because it is positively charged An anode is a negative electrode on a battery and a positive electrode on an electrolytic cell
