 Topoisomerase is an enzyme that unwinds and winds DNA in order to help the creation of DNA structures DNA is in a helix spiral which helps make the structure of DNA strong and stable However when undergoing DNA replication the spiral needs to be untwisted and when spirals are being untwisted knots and breaks can happen When studying the structure of DNA James D Watson and Francis Crick knew that there was need for an enzyme to overcome this problem Topoisomerase binds to either side of the DNA strands and allows the DNA to be untangled or unwound
