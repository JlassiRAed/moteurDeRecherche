In mathematics the empty set is the set that has no things in it For example consider the set of integer numbers between two and three Since there are no integer numbers between two and three the set of integer numbers between them is empty Any Proposition statement about all elements of the empty set is considered Truth true For example all integers between two and three are greater then seven This only makes sense because there are no integers between two and three
