In geometry a stereographic projection is a function plane The projection is defined on the entire sphere except for one point called the projection point Intuitively the stereographic projection is a way of picturing a sphere as a plane with some inevitable compromises Because the sphere and the plane appear in many areas of mathematics and its applications so does the stereographic projection it finds use in diverse fields including complex analysis cartography geology and photography In practice the projection is carried out by computer or by hand using a special kind of graph paper called a stereonet or Wulff net A simple example of such a projection encountered in everyday life is the sun casting a shadow of a globe onto the ground
