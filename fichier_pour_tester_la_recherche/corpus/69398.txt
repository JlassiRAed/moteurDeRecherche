A photo flash capacitor is a capacitor used in the flashes of camera s A camera flash works by applying short bursts of high voltage to a type of gas in a glass tube The electrical energy required is small but it has to be given very fast because since the flash doesn t last long An ordinary battery cannot give such a high voltage or give it so fast so a photo flash capacitor is used An electronic circuit increases the battery voltage and charges a capacitor When the button is pressed the capacitor releases the stored energy in about a thousandth of a second and makes a bright flash
