A padlock is a type of portable lock that has a U shaped shackle that will not come apart from the body of the lock unless the correct key is inserted or the correct combination is dialed The U shape of the lock allows for a wide variety of uses Typically the padlock is used to lock two things together for example a door and its frame two or more chain s or a chain and a fixed object Padlocks are not recommended for high security applications because the shackle is easily cut with a bolt cutter or hacksaw Some newer padlocks have hardened boron alloy shackles or shrouded shackles to make them more difficult to cut
