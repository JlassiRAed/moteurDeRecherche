 Sublimation is the process by which a solid transforms into a gas without passing through the liquid stage At normal atmospheric pressure on the surface of the Earth only some compounds like dry ice can go through this process Most substances can only sublimate at lower pressure Many can sublimate in Outer space space Snow may look like it disappears on a cold sunny day but this is not sublimation because it forms a thin layer of liquid water first A better example is CO which changes from a solid to a gas without being a liquid Also diamond graphite iodine ammonium chloride and aluminium chloride sublime rather than melt at atmospheric pressure
