 Stellar precession is the name for one of the ways the star s slowly move across the sky when seen from the Earth The best known thing this causes is making the north star s place in the sky slowly change over thousands of years It is caused by the Sun s gravity pulling the Earth s North Pole poles toward itself Because the Earth s poles are axial tilt tilted at an angle of Degree degrees from straight up in relation to its orbit this causes the North Pole to seem to point at different places in the sky Although it takes a very long time for the pole to make a whole circle in the sky even over the time period that humans have had writing this has made a big difference in what star is seen as the north star When the ancient Egypt ians built the pyramids about years ago they used the stars to make the edges line up with north and south However they did not use the same north star that we do because Earth s North Pole pointed at a different star than it does today Astronomer s have known about this movement for a very long time Most people think that Hipparchus discovered it in ancient Greece in about BC but some people think that even the ancient Egyptians may have known about it
