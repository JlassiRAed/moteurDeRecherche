 Eudicot Magnoliid Amborella Nymphaeales Austrobaileyales Chloranthales Ceratophyllum Monocotyledon Monocot The dicotyledons also known as dicots were one of the two groups of flowering plant s or angiosperms The name refers to one of the characteristics of the group namely that the seed has two embryonic leaves or cotyledon s There are around species in this group The other group of flowering plants were called monocotyledon s or monocots with one cotyledon Historically these two groups formed the two divisions of the flowering plants From the s onwards sequence analysis molecular phylogeny showed what botanists already suspected dicotyledons are not a monophyletic group They are a number of lineages such as the magnoliids Groups now known as basal angiosperms diverged earlier than the monocots did The traditional dicots are a Paraphyly paraphyletic group The largest clade of the dicotyledons are known as the eudicots They are definitely monophyletic They are distinguished from all other flowering plants by the structure of their pollen Other dicotyledons and monocotyledons have an older type of pollen whereas eudicots have derived pollen
