 Polyurethane is a polymer Its name is often shortened to PU or PUR Polyurethane is made of organic units which are joined by urethane Polyurethane polymers are formed through step growth polymerization In this process a monomer containing at least two isocyanate functional group s reacts with another monomer containing at least two hydroxyl groups in the presence of a catalyst Polyurethane is available with different levels of stiffness hardness or densities Examples for such materials are Polyurethanes are widely used in high resiliency flexible foam seating rigid foam insulation panels microcellular foam seal seal s and gasket s durable elastomeric wheels and tires automotive suspension bushing s electrical potting compounds high performance adhesive s and sealants Spandex Synthetic fiber fibers seals gaskets carpet underlay and hard plastic parts Polyurethane products are often called urethanes They should not be confused with the specific substance urethane also known as ethyl carbamate Polyurethanes are neither produced from ethyl carbamate nor do they contain it
