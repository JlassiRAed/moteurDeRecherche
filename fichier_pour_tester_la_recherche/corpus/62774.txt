 X radiation is a kind of electromagnetic radiation X rays are Wave These are all parts of the electromagnetic spectrum The wavelength of X rays covers a wide Spectrum range Most X rays have a wavelength in the range of to nanometre s This corresponds with Frequency frequencies in the range Hertz petahertz to Hertz exahertz and energies in the range Electronvolt eV to keV X rays can go through many solid material s For this reason taking photogram s with X rays is used in medicine in order to see bone s and other things inside the body Sometimes the term X Ray means these pictures instead of the radiation that makes them What these images show will depend on three things Rayleigh scattering cite web X rays are made by hitting metal with fast moving electron s They are photon s tiny packets of energy that can move atoms and change chemicals in the body The things they do depend on the wavelength of the X rays cause pair production X rays used for making pictures of people have low to medium energy Radiation therapy that treats cancer uses Compton scattering and sometimes Pair production There are small amounts of X rays in the air Like other Ionizing radiation energy in the air X rays can change living cells Exposing the human body to high doses of X rays for a long time is dangerous It can cause cancer However cancer cells are hurt more easily so X rays are sometimes used to Radiation therapy kill them
