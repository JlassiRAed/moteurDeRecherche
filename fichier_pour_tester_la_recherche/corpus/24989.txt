 Meiosis is a special type of cell division Unlike mitosis the way normal body cells divide meiosis results in cells that only have half the usual number of chromosome s one from each pair For that reason meiosis is often called reduction division In the long run meiosis increases genetics genetic Variation variation in a way which will be explained later Sexual reproduction takes place when a sperm fertilizes an Ovum egg The eggs and sperm are special cells called gamete s or sex cells Gametes are haploid they have only half the number of chromosome s as a normal body cell Fertilization restores the chromosomes in body cells to the diploid number The basic number of chromosomes in the body cells of a species is called the somatic number and is labelled n In humans n we have chromosomes In the sex cells the chromosome number is n The only exception are the sex chromosomes In mammals the female has two X chromosomes and the male one X and one Y chromosome A karyotype is the characteristic chromosome number of a eukaryote species The preparation and study of karyotypes is part of cytogenetics the genetics of cells All eukaryote s that reproduce sexually use meiosis This also includes many single celled organisms Meiosis does not occur in archaea or bacteria which reproduce by asexual processes such as binary fission
