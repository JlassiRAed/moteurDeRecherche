A world line is the unique path that an object has as it travels through both space and time usually called spacetime As you probably know from special relativity the faster an object goes the more time slows down for that object As you can see in the illustration to the right the slower object has a quicker passage of time than the very fast object the one which time passes much more slowly for When an object reaches the speed of light it will be zero on the t axis meaning that it will have made no progress in the time direction Basically the worldliness show that when the speed of light is reached time stops for the observer World lines are very often used in theoretical physics and special relativity as well as general relativity
