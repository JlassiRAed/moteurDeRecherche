 Magnetic resonance imaging inside the body Magnetic resonance uses nuclear magnetic resonance to generate these images To take an MRI image the patient lies on a movable bed The bed enters a strong magnetic field and then radio wave s are applied for a short time in a different direction This sudden shift causes certain atoms in the patient s body to make special signals The MRI scanner detects those special signals The MRI scanner then sends the signal information to a computer and the computer creates an image of the inner body by using the signal information
