 Oxidation state refers to the number of electron s added to or removed from an Chemical element element Sodium metal for example has an oxidation state of in the elemental state But when it gives up its one valence it becomes a sodium ion with an oxidation state of Iron is another example It can lose two electrons forming an oxidation state of or it can lose forming an oxidation state of If elements gain electrons they have negative oxidation states If chlorine gains an electron it forms a ion If sulfur gains two electrons it forms a ion The oxidation state determines the number of atoms of other elements that can Wikt bind bind to the atom All elements have an oxidation state of oxygen has an oxidation number in most of its compounds except peroxide s where it has an oxidation number hydrogen has oxidation state in most compounds except with electropositive elements ex Na alkali earth metal s have oxidation state alkali metal s have oxidation state chem stub
