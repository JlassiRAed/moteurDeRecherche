 Measure ment is a process that uses number s to describe things based on what we can observation observe about them This is done to be able to compare them to each other We can measure how big things are how warm they are how heavy they are and lots of other features as well Units of Measurement provide standards for our comparisons so that the numbers from our measurements refer to the same thing For example the metre is a standard unit to measure length Before it was defined as the distance between two markers on a special rod Now scientists define the metre as a fraction of the speed of light Saying something has a length of metres means that it is exactly twice as long as that rod used to define the metre or that light takes twice the time defined for a metre to travel that distance Today most units of measure fall into one of three System of measurement systems The older two the Imperial units British imperial system and the closely related United States customary units US customary system use the Foot pound as a measure for weight and the second as a measure for time There are other units as well In these systems the number of smaller units that make the bigger units varies For example there are inch es in a foot and ounce s in a pound A newer system is the metric system or SI units SI system which usually use of the smaller unit to make the bigger one It uses the metre for length the kilogram for weight and as with the others the second for time
