 Real time computing is a field of Computer science The idea is to design systems that have a real time constraint Real time systems will guarantee to give a result within a specified time There are two kinds of real time systems Hard real time systems After the delay has passed the result is totally useless No matter what happens hard real time systems deliver the result in the specified time Real world examples are the controller for the airbag in a car The reaction time of an airbag system is around ms Another example for a hard real time system is the Anti lock braking system in a car If it does not react fast enough an accident will occur People might die because the result was not there fast enough Soft real time systems On average these systems work fast enough to make it feel like real time A videoconferencing system has microseconds to record sound and video to send them to the other party and to process the incoming data If at one time this cannot be done the video will be blurred and the sound may be out of sync for a few moments This is however not a catastrophe and the system can continue to work
