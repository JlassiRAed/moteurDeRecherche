 Quantum tunnelling is a part of the theoretical branch of physics known as quantum mechanics It states electron s can behave like both Particle physics particles and Wave waves and can cancel the effects of an energy barrier if the energy barrier is thin enough due to quantum mechanics being quite dependent on probability In other words particles can travel through walls doors etc if the door or wall is thin enough The particle mdash usually a Subatomic particle subatomic or quark particle such as an electron or photon mdash can become a wave to focus a great deal of energy on the barrier ultimately negating it There is also a non zero chance that it could be found inside the barrier However this only noticeably works for subatomic particle s as the chance for macroscopic objects to do this is very very low small enough to not be thought about much
