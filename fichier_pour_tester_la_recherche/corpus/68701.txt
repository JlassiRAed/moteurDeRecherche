A nurse is a person who is trained to give care and to keep them fit and healthy Nurses also help with end of life needs and assist other family members with grieving Nursing is a profession like a doctor but training for a nurse is different in how long a person must Teaching train and what kind of training they need In some places nurses may train for three to five years or more before they get a license as a nurse Nurses work in many places Nurses work in hospital s in doctor s offices and in the community and they even visit people at home if they can not get out Sometimes people decide to become nurses rather than doctors because the nurses will be able to help patients directly by talking to them doing things they need carefully watching that nothing goes wrong and then seeing them as they get better Like doctors nurses can specialize in what work they do Some nurses train and work to help during surgery Some nurses train to help people understand health problems like nutrition Nurses can do many different jobs to help people Nurses are in demand because there are not enough nurses to handle hospital needs Because of this shortage nurses will sometimes travel to another location to work for a few months in what is called travel nursing
