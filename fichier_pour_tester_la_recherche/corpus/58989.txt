A thioether is a molecule with the functional group group R S R The first atom in R is a carbon Thioether take their name from ether s They have a sulfur instead of an oxygen atom between the two R Thioethers can have very bad smells like thiol s They can also be called sulfides The C S C bond is at nearly degrees Thioethers are important in biology They are present in some amino acid s Petroleum has many thioethers in it as well Thioethers can be made in the laboratory by the chemical reaction reaction of a thiol with a base and an electrophile They can do many interesting reactions It is easy to oxidation oxidise them to sulfoxide s and then sulfone s Dimethyl sulfide is the simplest thioether It is used in important reactions like the Swern oxidation This makes aldehyde s starting from alcohol s
