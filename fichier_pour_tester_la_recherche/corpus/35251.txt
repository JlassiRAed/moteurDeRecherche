The collision between the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxy Andromeda will happen in the future It will not happen for about four billion years The Andromeda galaxy is approaching the Milky Way at about as shown by its blueshift cite journalIn researchers concluded that the collision is sure to happen They used the Hubble Space Telescope to track the motion of stars in Andromeda between and with great accuracy Andromeda s tangential or sideways velocity with respect to the Milky Way was much smaller than the speed of approach Therefore it is expected that it will collide with the Milky Way in around billion years Such collisions are relatively common Andromeda for example has collided with at least one other galaxy in the past Several dwarf galaxy dwarf galaxies such as SagDEG are already colliding with the Milky Way and being merged into it
