An indirect tax is a tax that is paid as part of a product Many countries tax gasoline or cigarette s but they do so indirectly Because of the tax the product will be more expensive In turn the shops will then pay the tax for the number of packets of cigarettes they sold or for the amount of gasoline This is opposed to a direct tax which is directly paid by the consumer
