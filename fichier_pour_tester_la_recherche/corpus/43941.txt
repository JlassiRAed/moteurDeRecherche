In physics a Force force does work when it acts on a body and there is a displacement of the point of application in the direction of the force The work done by a force acting on a body is the force along the direction of the displacement multiplied by the displacement of the point of application It is the force that does the work not the agent that created the force Movement Motion is a requirement of work Like energy it is a scalar quantity with SI units of joule s According to the work energy theorem if an external force acts upon a rigid object causing its kinetic energy to change from E where m is the mass of the object and v is the object s velocity If a constant force F acts on an object while the object is displaced a distance d and the force and displacement are parallel to each other the work done on the object is the product of F and d If the force and the displacement are in the same direction the work is positive If the force and the displacement are in opposite directions the work is negative For example the work done by the weight on a book being lifted is negative This is because the downward weight is in the opposite direction to the upward displacement
