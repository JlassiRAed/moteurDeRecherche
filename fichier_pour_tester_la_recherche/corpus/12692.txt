 Electronics is the study of how to control the flow of Electron electrons It deals with Electrical circuit circuits made up of Electronic component components that control the flow of electricity Electronics is a part of physics and electrical engineering Electrical components like transistors and relays can act as switches This lets us use electrical circuits to Signal processing process information and Telecommunication transmit information across long distances Circuits can also take a weak signal Most electronic systems fall into two categories One way of looking at an electronic system is to separate it into three parts Inputs Electrical or mechanical sensor s which take signal and convert them into electric current and voltage signals Signal processing circuits These consist of electronic components connected together to manipulate interpret and transform the information contained in the signals Outputs Actuator s or other devices that transform current and voltage signals back into human readable information A television set for example has as its input a broadcast signal received from an antenna or for cable television a cable Signal processing circuits inside the television set use the brightness colour and sound information contained in the received signal to control the television set s output devices The display output device may be a cathode ray tube plasma or liquid crystal display screen The audio output device might be a magnetic ally driven audio loudspeaker speaker The display output devices convert the signal processing circuits brightness and colour information into the visible image displayed on a screen The audio output device converts the processed sound information into sounds that can be heard by listeners Analysis of a electrical circuit circuit network involves knowing the input and the signal processing circuit and finding out the output Knowing the input and output and finding out or Circuit design designing the signal processing part is called synthesis
