 New Horizons is a space probe launched by NASA on January to the dwarf planet Pluto and on an escape trajectory from the Sun It is the first man made spacecraft to go to Pluto Its flight took eight years It arrived at the Pluto Charon Charon system on July It flew near Pluto and took photographs and measurements while it passed It is transmitting them back to Earth The primary mission of New Horizons is to study Pluto and its system of moons The secondary mission is to study any objects in the Kuiper belt Kuiper Belt if something became available for a flyby The space probe set the record for the fastest man made object ever launched with the Earth relative speed of about km s although arguably the Helios probes got a faster Sun relative speed It used a gravity assist from Jupiter to get its high speeds without having to burn as much monopropellant as needed to fly directly to Pluto In the probe is expected to flyby and study a small Kuiper Belt object After that it won t have enough propellant to go to another target It will continue to report about its environment
