In mathematics a holomorphic function is a function function that is defined on the complex number s and that can be differentiated everywhere where it is defined Differentiating the function again leads to a function defined on the complex numbers In older literature these functions are sometimes called regular Holomorphic functions show a number of properties function defined on real number s do not have
