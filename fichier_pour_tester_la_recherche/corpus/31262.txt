 Linear algebra is a branch of mathematics It came from mathematicians trying to solve systems of linear equation s Vectors and matrix matrices are used to solve these systems The main objects of study currently are vector space s and linear mapping s between vector spaces Linear algebra is useful in other branches of mathematics It can also be applied to the real world in areas such as engineering physics and economics Linear algebra describes ways to wikt solve solve and manipulate systems of linear equation s For example consider the following equations begin matrix x y x y end matrix These two equations form a system of linear equations It is linear because none of the variable s are raised to a exponentiation power The graph of a linear equation in two variables is a straight line The solution to this system is begin matrix x y end matrix since it makes all of the original equations valid that is the value on left side of the equals sign is exactly the same as the value on the right side for both equations Linear algebra uses a system of notation for describing system behavior called a matrix matrix For the previous example the coefficient s of the equations can be stored in a coefficient matrix
