 Genomics is the part of genetics which studies the genomes of organisms This includes the entire DNA sequence of organisms and fine scale genetic mapping The field also includes studies of genes working together Examples are heterosis epistasis pleiotropy and other interactions between loci and allele s within the genome Genomics applies recombinant DNA DNA sequencing methods and bioinformatics to sequence assemble and analyze the function and structure of genome s This is the complete set of DNA within a single cell of an organism The United States Environmental Protection Agency has a somewhat broader definition The term genomics encompasses a broader scope of scientific inquiry associated technologies than when genomics was initially considered A genome is the sum total of all an individual organism s genes Thus genomics is the study of all the genes of a cell or tissue at the DNA levels
