A cellular automaton is a Scientific modeling model used in computer science and mathematics The idea is to model a dynamic system by using a number of cells Each cell has one of several possible states With each turn or iteration the state of the current cell is determined by two things its current state and the states of the neighbouring cells A very famous example of a cellular automata is Conway s Game of Life Stanislaw Ulam and John von Neumann first described cellular automata in the s Conway s Game of Life was first shown in the s
