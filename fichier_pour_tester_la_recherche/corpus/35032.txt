 The human shoulder is made up of three bones the clavicle as well as muscle s ligament s and tendon s The articulations between the bones of the shoulder make up the shoulder joint s The shoulder joint is the part of the body where the humerus attaches to the scapula the head sitting in the glenoid fossa The shoulder as a whole is the complete group of structures in the region of the joint There are two kinds of cartilage in the joint The first type is the white cartilage on the ends of the bones the joint becomes painful and stiff The labrum is a second kind of cartilage in the shoulder which is distinctly different from the articular cartilage This cartilage is more fibrous or rigid than the cartilage on the ends of the ball and socket Also this cartilage is also found only around the socket where it is attached The shoulder must be mobile enough for the wide range actions of the arms and hands but also stable enough to allow for actions such as lifting pushing and pulling The compromise between wikt motion mobility and wikt stability stability results in a large number of shoulder problems not faced by other joints such as the hip
