The standard error is the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of a statistic The term may also be used for an estimate sample of the whole group The mean average of some part of a group is the usual way to estimate the average for the whole group It is often too hard or costs too much money to measure the whole group But if a different sample is measured it will have an average that is a little bit different from the first sample The standard error of the mean is a way to know how close the average of the sample is to the average of the whole group It is a way to know how sure you can be about the average from the sample In real measurements the true value of the standard deviation of the mean for the whole group is usually not known So the term standard error is often used to mean a close guess to the true number for the whole group The more measurements there are in a sample the closer the guess will be to the true number for the whole group
