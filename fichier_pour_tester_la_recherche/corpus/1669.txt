A microcontroller First released in by the Intel company microcontrollers began to become popular in their first few years The extremely useful Intel microprocessor was then released but it was still impractical because of high cost for each chip These first microcontrollers combined different types of computer Computer memory memory on one unit After people began to see how useful they were micro controllers were constantly being upgraded with people trying to find new ways to make them better Cost was reduced over time and by the early s micro controllers were widely used across the world Other terms for a microcontroller are embedded system and embedded controller because the microcontroller and its support circuits are often built into or embedded in a single chip In addition to the usual Arithmetic logic unit arithmetic and logic elements of a general microprocessor the microcontroller also has additional elements such as RAM for data storage read only memory for program storage flash memory for permanent data storage and other devices Microcontrollers often operate at very low speed compared to microprocessors Microcontrollers are used in automatic products and device s such as car engine systems remote control s machine s appliance s power tool s and toy toys These are called embedded system s Microcontrollers can also be found at work in solar power and energy harvesting anti lock braking systems in cars and have many uses in the medical field as well
