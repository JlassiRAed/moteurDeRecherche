 Snell s law is the scientific law of the refraction of light or other wave s In optics Snell s law is about the speed of light in different media The law states that when light passes through different materials angle does not change With each is the refractive index of the medium The index of refraction of a vacuum is and the velocity of light in a vacuum is Snell s law can be proved by Fermat s principle Fermat s principle states that light travels along the path which takes the least time
