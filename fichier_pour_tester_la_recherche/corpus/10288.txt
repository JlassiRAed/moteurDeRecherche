In mathematics a number can not be Division divided by zero Observe A If B then C This is true But look Which is the same as The problem is that A could be any number It would work if A were or if it were is said to be of indeterminate form for this reason because it has no single value Numbers of the form A on the other hand where A is not are said to be undefined This is because any attempt to define them will result in a value of infinity which is itself undefined Usually when two numbers are equal to the same thing they are equal to each other That is not true when the thing they are both equal to is This means that the normal rules of maths do not work when the number is divided by zero
