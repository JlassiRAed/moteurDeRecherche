In cryptography MacGuffin is a block cipher created in by Bruce Schneier and Matt Blaze at a Fast Software Encryption Fast Software Encryption workshop It was intended as a catalyst for analysis of a new cipher structure known as Generalized Unbalanced Feistel cipher Feistel Networks Schneier and Blaze based MacGuffin on Data Encryption Standard DES their main change was spliting the DES Block size MacGuffin s key schedule is a modified version of the encryption algorithm itself Since MacGuffin is a Feistel network decryption is easy simply run the encryption algorithm in reverse The algorithm was experimental intended to explore the security properties of unbalanced Feistel networks The cryptanalysis proceeded very quickly so quickly that the cipher was broken using differential cryptanalysis at the same workshop by Vincent Rijmen and Bart Preneel They also tried attacking MacGuffin with different Substitution box S boxes taken directly from DES This version was slightly stronger Rijmen and Preneel warn that designing an algorithm to resist only known attacks is generally not a good design principle Schneier and Blaze recommended using rounds and specified MacGuffin with a bit key
