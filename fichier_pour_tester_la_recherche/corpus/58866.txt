 Theoretical particles are particles that have been assumed or predicted to exist by scientists but have not been proven in any experiment Some like the tachyon probably don t exist since they violate several laws of physics However many are still believed to exist All Supersymmetry supersymmetric particles are theoretical Supersymmetrical particles are often abbreviated with an s in front of the particle name like a sfermion Particles found in antimatter are not theoretical particles because they have been found in numerous experiments
