A driveshaft drive shaft driving shaft propeller shaft or Cardan shaft is a part of a machine that takes power power from the engine or motor to a place where useful Mechanical work work can be done Most engines or motors create power as torque by making something rotate This can be from an internal combustion engine torsion and shear stress Drive shafts need to be strong enough to take this stress A light drive shaft will more efficiently move the power to the load so there needs to be a balance between strength and weight
