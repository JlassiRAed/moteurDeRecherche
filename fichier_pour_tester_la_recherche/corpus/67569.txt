In computer science a program specification is the definition of what a computer program is expected to do It can be informal in which case it can be considered as a blueprint or user manual from a developer point of view or formal in which case it has a definite meaning defined in mathematical or programmatic terms In practice most successful specifications are written to understand and fine tune applications that were already well developed although safety critical software systems are often carefully specified prior to application development Specifications are most important for external interfaces that must remain stable
