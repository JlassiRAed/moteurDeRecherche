A cache can be used to improve the performance of accessing a given resource When there are several such caches for the same resource as shown in the picture this can lead to problems Cache coherence or Cache coherency refers to a number of ways to make sure all the caches of the resource have the same data and that the data in the caches makes sense Cache coherence is a special case of memory coherence There may be problems if there are many caches of a common memory resource as data in the cache may no longer make sense or one cache may no longer have the same data as the others A common case where the problem occurs is the cache of CPU s in a multiprocessing system As can be seen in the figure if the top client has a copy of a memory block from a previous read and the bottom client changes that memory block the top client could be left with an invalid cache of memory without knowing Cache coherence is there to manage such conflicts and maintain consistency between cache and memory
