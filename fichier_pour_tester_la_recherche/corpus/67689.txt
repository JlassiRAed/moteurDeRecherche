In geology a sill is a flat sheet like Intrusion intrusion As molten magma it pushed between older stratum layers of rock The older rock may be sedimentary rock beds of volcanic lava or tuff or metamorphic rock The sill does not cut across preexisting rocks unlike Dyke dykes Sills are fed by dykes as they form from a lower magma source The existing rocks must split to create the planes along which the magma moves in These planes or weakened areas allow the intrusion of a thin sheet like body of magma parallel ing the existing strata When it cools and crystallization crystallises it is then a sill
