A heuristic is a practical way to solve a problem It is better than chance but does not always work A person develops a heuristic by using intelligence experience and common sense Trial and error is the simplest heuristic but one of the weakest Rule of thumb and educated guesses are other names for simple heuristics Since a heuristic is not certain to get a result there are always exceptions Sometimes heuristics are rather vague look before you leap is a guide to behaviour but think about the consequences is a bit clearer Sometimes a heuristic is a whole set of stages When doctors examines a patient they go through a whole set of tests and observations They may not find out what is wrong but they give themselves the best chance of succeeding This is called a diagnosis In computer science a heuristic is a kind of algorithm Algorithms are written to get a good solution to a problem A heuristic algorithm might usually find pretty good solutions but there is no guarantee or Mathematical proof proof that the solutions are correct The time it takes to run the algorithm is another consideration
