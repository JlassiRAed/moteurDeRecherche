A telescope is an important tool for astronomy that gathers light and directs it to a single point Some do this with curved mirror s some with curved Lens lenses and some with both Telescopes make faraway things look bigger brighter and closer Galileo Galilei Galileo was the first person to use a telescope for astronomy but he did not invent them The first telescope was invented in the Netherlands in Some telescopes not mainly used for astronomy are binoculars camera lens es or spyglasses The word telescope is usually used for light your eyes can see but there are telescopes for invisible light Infrared telescope s look like normal telescopes but have to be kept cold since all warm things give off infrared light Radio telescope s are like radio antennas usually shaped like large dishes X ray and Gamma ray telescopes have a problem because the rays go through most metals and glasses To solve this problem the mirrors are shaped like a bunch of rings inside each other so the rays strike them at a shallow angle and are reflected These telescopes are space observatory space telescopes because not enough of this radiation reaches the Earth Other space telescopes are put in orbit so the Earth s atmosphere does not interfere
