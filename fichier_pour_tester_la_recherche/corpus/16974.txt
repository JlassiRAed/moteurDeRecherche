 Order theory is a field of mathematics It concerns itself with being able to compare different elements of a set Given a binary relation it is then possible to put all the elements of the set in a certain order It is also possible to say that a certain element comes before another one for that relation Another way to say this is to say that one of the two is smaller than the other For a specific set to be ordered it must be reflexive each element of the set is within a relation with itself anti symmetric if A and B are in relation and B is also in a relation with A then A must be equal to B transitive if A and B in a relation and B is in a relation with C then A and C must be in a relation
