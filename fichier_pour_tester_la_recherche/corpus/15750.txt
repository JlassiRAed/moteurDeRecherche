 Chromatophores are pigment containing and light reflecting cell cells found in amphibian s fish reptile s crustacean s and cephalopod s They are largely responsible for generating skin and eye colour in Poikilotherm cold blooded animals Some species can rapidly change colour so as to keep in camouflage or to signal They do this by moving pigment and reflective plates in chromatophores This process is called physiological colour change Cephalopods such as octopus have complex chromatophore organs controlled by muscles to achieve this The display is under central nervous control based usually on input from the eyes Vertebrate s such as chameleon s get a similar effect by Signal transduction cell signalling Such signals can be hormone s or neurotransmitter s They may be started by changes in mood temperature Stress stress or visible changes around the animal
