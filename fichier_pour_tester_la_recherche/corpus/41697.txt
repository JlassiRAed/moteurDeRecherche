In mosaic evolution some characters in a transitional form are basal while others are remarkably advanced Apparently evolution ary change takes place rapidly in some body parts or systems without wikt simultaneous simultaneous changes in other parts Evolution from a basal traits These changes play a leading role in major evolutionary transitions It may involve speciation s producing a series of species only a few of which would be found as fossil s By its very nature the evidence for this idea comes mainly from palaeontology It is not claimed that this pattern is universal but it is common There are now a wide range of examples from many different taxa
