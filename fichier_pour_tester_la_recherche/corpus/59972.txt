The ancient Chinese musical system depends on very ancient mathematics used to determine sound frequencies The easiest way to explain it is to work through a real example Suppose that somebody wanted to make a musical instrument that could play any song in the ancient Chinese system Here are the instructions Make a wooden box cm long and cm wide Put guides for the strings near each end of the box and fix it so that these two guides are cm apart Multiply cm by which is cm Place a fret all the way across the box on the cm line Multiply cm by which is cm Place a fret along the cm line Multiply cm by which is cm Place a fret along this line Multiply cm by which is cm Place a fret along this line Multiply cm by which is cm Place a fret along this line Multiply cm by which is cm Place a fret along this line Multiply cm by which is and which is too short so double it to get cm Place a fret along this line Multiply cm by Multiply the previous answer by Keep going until you have put down eleven frets Counting the frequency on the open string and the frequencies on the fretted strings for each string there will be defined frequencies Tune the bottom string to some basic frequency Tune the next string to the frequency of the bottom string at the first fret Tune the third string to the bottom string s second fret Keep going until you have tuned all twelve strings When you pluck these strings at all the fretted and unfretted positions you will get frequencies Some of them will be duplicates but not as many as you might think because this system is not like the Equal tempered system now used for almost all Western music Out of each twelve frequencies on a single string you can make many selections of either five frequencies Here is a chart showing how frequencies and scales can be produced The frequency of hertz could have been any other frequency Once this frequency is chosen it is multiplied by the ratio s to produce the first column of frequencies Each of these frequencies is used to start its own column Any five frequencies in a column can be chosen to make a pentatonic scale as long as they are not right together and are not more than two apart In the United States students are taught the scale whose notes are named do re mi fa sol la and ti Those seven produce a major scale In Western music we also use a minor scale fairly frequently But we only have those two Chinese traditional music uses five different scales of five notes each It also has pentatonic scales but they are not discussed in this article
