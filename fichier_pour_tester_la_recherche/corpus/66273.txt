 Cosmic background microwave radiation is radiation in the microwave part of the electromagnetic spectrum which comes from all directions in outer space We know that it comes from very far away so we think that it is the oldest signal that we can detect During the Big Bang a lot of high energy radiation was created Then the universe became bigger and colder Therefore the high energy photon s lost most of their original energy Now as a result that radiation is in the microwave part of the electromagnetic spectrum The cosmic microwave background is the radiation that has been travelling without hitting anything ever since the time the universe became transparent about years after the Big Bang Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson first detected the CMB radiation Smoot Group The cosmic microwave background radiation Lawrence Berkeley Lab Scientists think that the existence of CMB radiation is important evidence with red shift that the Big Bang theory is true Later data is based on the Planck at microwave and infra red frequencies with high sensitivity and small angular resolution The spacecraft has finished its work but researchers are still analysing the data The main interest is that there is an asymmetry in the average temperatures on opposite hemispheres of the sky This runs counter to the prediction made by the standard model that the Universe should be broadly similar in any direction we look Furthermore a cold spot extends over a patch of sky that is much larger than expected Plank European Space Agency No explanation for this is known
