 Vector calculus is a branch of mathematics that investigates vector field vector fields and how they change over time Vector calculus usually studies two or three dimensional vector fields but can be used in higher dimensions too It is a part of the study of multivariable calculus Vector calculus is useful in physics and engineering because of how it can look at electromagnetic and gravitational fields
