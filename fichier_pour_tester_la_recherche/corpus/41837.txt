 Milton Keynes is a very large town in Buckinghamshire England In the government decided to start a large new town with the idea that it would become a city of people by the end of the th century twentieth century The place where it was built already included three towns and sixteen villages with about people living there More and more houses shops and factories are built every year By there were are about resident s Aeroplane s flying over ordinary towns can see roads that look like a spider s web But when they fly over Milton Keynes they see that its big roads look like a net or a grid The people who live there call the spaces between the busy roads grid squares and that is where they live Nobody lives right next to the big roads so there are no truck s going past the front door of people who live there So really Milton Keynes often seems more like a little villages than a big city People do not have to cross a busy road to get from one grid square to the next one because the roads go over bridge s and people can cross safely under them The paths that go under the roads and between the houses are called Redways because they are red in colour Only people on bicycles and people walking are allowed to use them Cars lorry lorries and motorbike s are not allowed to go on them So people could cycle all the way across the city and never have to go on a busy road
