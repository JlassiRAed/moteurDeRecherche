 Moore s law is that the number of transistor s on integrated circuit s doubles about every two years Intel executive David House said the period was months He predicted that period for a doubling in chip performance a combination of the effect of more transistors and their being faster The law is named after Intel co founder Gordon Moore who described the trend in his paper The paper stated that the number of components in integrated circuits had doubled every year from the invention of the integrated circuit in until and predicted that the trend would continue for at least ten years The capabilities of many digital electronic devices are strongly linked to Moore s law Clock rate processing speed RAM memory capacity sensors and even the number and size of pixel s in digital camera s All of these are improving at exponential function exponential rates as well This exponential improvement has greatly increased the effect of digital electronics in the world economy This trend has continued for more than half a century Sources in expected it to continue until at least or International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors after which transistor counts and densities are set to double every three years
