 Calendar s are commonly based on the rotation of celestial bodies such as the sun or the moon These calendars periodically add a certain time unit to make the calendar follow the rotation more closely which is known as intercalation As an example the solar year is about days long The Gregorian calendar says that the year has days but that roughly every four years an extra day is added Another example is the Jewish calendar which is a lunisolar calendar In addition to the days of the solar year there are the days in a lunar month This gives the problem that the year does not have twelve months but about months The calendar solves this problem by adding an extra month in certain cases
