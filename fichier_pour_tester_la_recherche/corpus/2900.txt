 File Hydrogenosom svg thumb right px Abb Model of ATP synthesis in hydrogenosomes abb CoA Coenzyme A A hydrogenosome is a membrane enclosed organelle of some Anaerobic organism anaerobic ciliate s trichomonas trichomonads fungi and a few metazoa The hydrogenosomes of trichomonads produce Adenosine triphosphate ATP by a complex metabolic cycle Unlike mitochondria this cycle does not use oxygen It is thought that hydrogenosomes evolved from mitochondria their structure is rather similar In scientists reported their discovery of the first known anaerobic Eumetazoa metazoans with hydrogenosome like organelles These organisms were Loricifera living in sediments under deep water brine pools like the L Atalante basin These brine pools are completely without any oxygen
