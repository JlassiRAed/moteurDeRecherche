In information theory redundancy means that a message is encoding encoded and tramsmitted using more bit s that are necessary to emcode the message If a piece of information is redundant it can be left out without loss of information Redudant information such as checksum s can be used to detect and correct errors in transmission or storage Operations like data compression reduce redundancy This can be good as the data can be sent more quickly and take less space It can also be bad if an error can no longer be corrected automatically When using database s redundancies must be avoided as they can lead to inconsistencies In this case the process is called Database normalisation normalisation
