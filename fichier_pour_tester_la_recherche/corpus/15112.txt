 Plutonium is the chemical element with the atomic number and chemical symbol Pu It is a highly radioactive metal It is the metal used in most nuclear weapon s The chemical element plutonium has some different isotopes The most important isotope of plutonium is Pu is long enough that some of this isotope of plutonium is found in very small amounts in nature Plutonium is used in Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator s Like other transuranium element s plutonium can react with water oxygen carbon halogen s nitrogen and silicon It forms oxide s and hydride s in moist air causing the plutonium sample to expand by up to Plutonium from the expanding sample can flake off and catch fire at room temperature Plutonium is also toxic although it is less toxic than many people think The reactivity and toxicity of plutonium make it difficult to handle
