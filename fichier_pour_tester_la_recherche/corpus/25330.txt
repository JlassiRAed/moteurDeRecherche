 has been advanced by Georgi Dvali and Cesar Gomez which suggests a black hole is an overpacked bucket of gravitons There are some theories that suggest that gravitons would make up a new group of particles attraction particles Cern is currently smashing more particles using the LHC to try to find this particle Because the graviton is a particle that has force it is classed as a gauge boson Other gauge bosons include the photon the gluon and the W and Z bosons W and Z particles If someone found one it could lead to a theory which would join together the four main physical forces electromagnetism gravity strong force and weak force
