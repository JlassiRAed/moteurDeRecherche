 Hydroxide in chemistry is a name given to the diatomic anion OH made up of oxygen and hydrogen atom s Most chemical compounds that contain hydroxides are base bases An Arrhenius base is a substance that when solvation dissolved in an aqueous solution it produces hydroxide ion s Therefore hydroxide ions are heavily involved in acid base reactions Many useful chemical reactions or processes involve hydroxide or hydroxide ions Sodium hydroxide is used in industry as a strong base potassium hydroxide is used in agriculture and iron hydroxide minerals such as goethite and limonite have been used as iron ore The aluminium ore bauxite is made mainly out of aluminium hydroxides Most inorganic hydroxide salts do not dissolve in water
