 Chrysochloridae Tenrecidae Afrosoricida is an Order order of mammal s which includes the Tenrecidae Tenrecs and the Golden mole Tenrecs look like hedgehog s in appearance Golden moles look like mole s Sequence analysis found that these animals are not closely related to other insectivore s Some biologists use Tenrecomorpha as the name for the tenrec golden mole clade but Gary Bronner and Paulina Jenkins argue that Afrosoricida is more appropriate despite their misgivings about the similarity between the name Afrosoricida and the unrelated shrew sub genus Afrosorex
