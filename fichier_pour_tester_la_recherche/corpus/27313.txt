A solar cell or Photovoltaics photovoltaic cell is a device that converts light energy into electricity electrical energy Sometimes the term solar cell is reserved for devices intended specifically to capture energy from sunlight while the term photovoltaic cell is used when the light source is unspecified The device needs to fulfill only two functions photogeneration of charge carriers in a light absorbing material and separation of the charge carriers to a conductive contact that will transmit the electricity This conversion is called the photovoltaic effect and the field related to solar cells is known as photovoltaics
