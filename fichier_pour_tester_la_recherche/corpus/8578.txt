In graphic arts perspective is the representation of how an image is seen by the eye It is about how the angle and distance of a D three dimensional object is represented on a D flat surface To create a real scene objects are drawn smaller to show that they are farther away from the person looking at the artwork The dimension s of an object are also drawn differently depending where the line of sight is The size of an object s dimensions along the line of sight are usually drawn shorter than dimensions across the line of sight This is called foreshortening and is used to create the appearance of three dimensions on a flat surface Landscape paintings have a horizon line This line represents objects that are infinitely far away They have shrunk in the distance like objects on the Earth s horizon Changing the height of the horizon level changes the view point for the picture A person lying on the ground and looking up would have a different view to a person on a ladder looking down
