 Commensalism is a type of relationship between two organisms In commensalism one organism is helped while the other is not affected In practice it is difficult to show that the passive organism is not harmed For example some birds live in holes in trees Does this damage the tree Mite s which cannot fly often hitch a ride on insects Does this affect theinsect s fitness There is no definite answer to such questions Orchid s moss es and lichen s all grow on tropical trees They need sunlight and by being higher up they get to the sunlight All that can be said for sure is that the trees continue to live and reproduce and so it is assumed that these epiphyte s do not affect their host plant Pierre Joseph van Beneden
