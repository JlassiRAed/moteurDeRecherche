In cryptography a Feistel cipher is a symmetric structure used in the construction of block cipher s named after the German IBM cryptographer Horst Feistel it is also commonly known as a Feistel network A large set of block cipher s use the scheme including the Data Encryption Standard The Feistel structure has the advantage that encryption and decryption operations are very similar even identical in some cases requiring only a reversal of the key schedule Therefore the size of the code or circuitry required to implement such a cipher is nearly halved Feistel construction is iterative in nature which makes implementing the cryptosystem in hardware easier Feistel networks and similar constructions are product cipher s and so combine multiple rounds of repeated operations such as to produce a function with large amounts of what Claude Shannon described as confusion and diffusion Bit shuffling creates the Avalanche effect diffusion effect while substitution is used for confusion
