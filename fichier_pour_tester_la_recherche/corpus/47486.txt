 Proteins are long chain molecule s built from small units known as amino acid s They are joined together with peptide bond s They are biochemistry biochemical Chemical compound compounds consisting of one or more polypeptide s folded into a round or fibrous protein fibrous shape A polypeptide is a single linear polymer chain of amino acid s The sequence of amino acids in a polypeptide comes from the DNA sequence of a gene see Translation cofactor s Proteins are essential to all cell proteins take part in virtually every process in cells Many proteins are enzyme s that catalysis catalyze biochemical reactions and are vital to metabolism Other proteins have structural or mechanical functions such as in muscle and in cell s The cytoskeleton is a system of scaffolding that keeps cell shape Other proteins are important in Signal transduction cell signalling antibody immune response s and cell division
