 Tycho Brahe was an astronomer from Denmark He observed the night sky before the invention of the telescope He built a large observatory called Uraniborg on the island of Hven in Denmark He discovered that the universe outside the Solar System could change when he studied SN a supernova and a comet Johannes Kepler was his assistant Tycho made very careful observations of the planets When Tycho died in Kepler continued Tycho s work Tycho was not a modern scientist He believed in astrology and his astronomy was a strange mixture of scientific observation and religious belief Although he rejected the Claudius Ptolemaeus Ptolemaic system he also rejected the Copernicus Copernican system He developed a geocentrism geocentric theory that imagined the Sun and Moon orbited the Earth but the other planets orbited the Sun To his benefit he did not believe in the unchanging celestial realm or spheres The supernova proved that changes did take place Also he worked out that comets were real celestial objects and that their orbits were different to those of the planets
