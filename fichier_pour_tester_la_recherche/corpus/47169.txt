This is pretty much a copy of a recent blog post I made but I thought it d make an interesting article The last few days have been rough for the Simple English Wikipedia Following a dramatic ANI thread about User ChristianMan ChristianMan s unbanning on the w Main Page English Wikipedia EN now has the general idea that Simple is just a breeding ground for blocked EN editors to wreak havoc In the past week we ve had two blocked EN users become banned at Simple and they ve both socked after their ban I really don t know what direction the project is going in I think that the starting point for all of this was the infamous Simplewiki vandal known mostly by the name Static Also I myself drew up a mentoring plan for now banned editor User Tharnton Tharnton Static s fellow young and immature user Maybe it s our sheltering of such immature trolls that has given us such a bad reputation I don t really know if we can ever redeem ourselves blockquote
