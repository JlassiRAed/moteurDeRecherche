 Human skin colour is one of the most easily seen features of a person It ranges in variety from the darkest brown to the lightest pinkish white Skin colour is inherited and is the result of natural selection Skin pigment ation in human beings evolved mainly to control the amount of ultraviolet radiation penetrating the skin thus reducing its effects The single most important substance deciding human skin colour is the pigment melanin Melanin is produced within the skin by cells called melanocyte s The red colour underlying the skin becomes more visible in white skin especially in the face In physical exercise or the stimulation of the nervous system blood vessel s expand There is a direct relationship between UV radiation and the distribution of indigenous skin pigmentation around the world Areas that have more UVR also have darker skinned populations Areas that are far from the tropics and closer to the poles have lower concentration of UVR and lighter skinned populations Natural skin colour can also darken as a result of Sun tanning tanning due to exposure to sunlight The leading theory is that skin colour adapts to intense sunlight to provide partial protection against the ultraviolet radiation ultraviolet fraction which damages DNA of the skin cells and so produces mutations It is easy to see why dark skin is an advantage in the tropics as a partial defence against skin cancer It is much less easy to see why a white skin is an advantage in colder climates Researchers have suggested two reasons and both probably play a part The first is that at a given temperature a white skin radiates less heat than a black skin The second is that in weaker sunlight the body tends to produce less vitamin D There is a hypothesis that the selection for lighter skin is due to the need for higher vitamin D production The change started as soon as populations moved north out of Africa In addition adult human Woman female s are usually lighter in skin pigmentation than Man male s Females need more calcium during pregnancy and lactation The body synthesizes vitamin D from the action of sunlight on the skin Vitamin D helps the body absorb calcium Females evolved to have lighter skin so their bodies absorb more calcium The social significance of differences in skin color has varied across cultures and over time as demonstrated with regard to social status and discrimination
