 Kerberos user and the server verify each other s identity Kerberos protocol messages are protected against spying and replay attack s Kerberos performs authentication as a trusted third party authentication service by using cryptography cryptographic shared secret under the assumption that packets traveling along the security insecure network can be read modified and inserted Kerberos builds on Symmetric key algorithm symmetric key cryptography and requires a key distribution center Extensions to Kerberos can provide for the use of public key cryptography during certain phases of authentication
