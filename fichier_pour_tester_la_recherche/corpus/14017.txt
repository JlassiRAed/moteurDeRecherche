In physics dissipation includes the concept of a dynamical system where important mechanical modes such as wave s or oscillation s lose energy over time typically due to the action of friction or turbulence The lost energy is converted into thermodynamics heat raising the temperature of the system Such systems are called dissipative system s For example a wave that loses amplitude is said to dissipate The dissipative nature depends on the nature of the wave an atmospheric wave for instance may dissipate close to the surface due to friction with the land mass and at higher levels due to radiative cooling
