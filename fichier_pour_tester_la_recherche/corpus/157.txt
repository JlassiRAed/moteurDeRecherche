The Titans are the older kind of gods in Greek mythology The original Twelve Titans were children of Gaia Gaia and Uranos Later they fought against the newer Twelve Olympians Olympians but lost the war called the titanomachy Because of this the Olympians have the power and are more important and many Titans were put into the Tartaros in the Greek underworld
