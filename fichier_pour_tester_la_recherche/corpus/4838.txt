An intergenerational contract is an agreement between different generation s It assumes that future generations will honor the contract and provide a service to a generation that has done the same service for an older generation The most common use of the term is in social security and refers to the consensus to provide pension s for the retired generations through payments made by the working generations The use of the word contract is not entirely accurate as the next generation enters the agreement without consent
