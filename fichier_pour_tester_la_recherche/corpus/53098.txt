 Let it slide is a phrase in the English language which asks a person not to hold on so tightly that something they are holding cannot move or slide It is most often used when a person insists on an idea and tries so hard to convince another person of that idea that it seems nothing else matters A friend may say Let it slide even though this is important you can take an easy approach and any damage if any damage will not be too severe When you disagree strongly about an article but it is not completely incorrect or damaging just let it slide for a bit If it is seriously wrong another person will eventually come to your aid but if you press all you can on your own before any help arrives it may be too late So don t give up your idea but for now let it slide
