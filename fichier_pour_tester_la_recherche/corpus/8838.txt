In chemistry yield moles The fractional yield relative yield or percentage yield shows how completely a Chemical synthesis synthetic procedure worked It is calculated by dividing the amount of product by the theoretical yield To get the percentage yield one must multiplication multiply the fractional yield by The wikt ideal ideal percentage yield of a chemical reaction is but it cannot be wikt achieve achieve d because measurements are never completely accurate Yields around are quantitative yields above are excellent yields above are very good yields above are good yields below are fair however yields below are poor
