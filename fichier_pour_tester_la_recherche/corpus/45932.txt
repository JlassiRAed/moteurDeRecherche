An ocean current is a continuous movement of ocean water from one place to another Ocean currents are created by wind water temperature salt content and the gravity of the moon The current s direction and speed depend on the shoreline and the ocean floor They can flow for thousands of miles and are found in all the major oceans of the world One major example of an ocean current is the Gulf Stream in the Atlantic Ocean Ocean currents can be found on the water surface and deeper down Currents on the surface often depend on wind They travel clockwise in the northern hemisphere They travel Clockwise counterclockwise in the southern hemisphere They are found up to below the surface of the ocean Deeper currents depend on water pressure temperature and salt content
