 FLAC is a way to code audio files It makes those audio files smaller without affecting the sound quality It is unlike MP because when encoding audio using an MP encoder information is lost and cannot be recovered When a FLAC file is decoded it will be identical to the original raw audio FLAC is the most common lossless audio codec Lossy encoders such as MP encoders will generate smaller files than lossless encoders such as FLAC although with a lossy codec the decoder s output will not be exactly identical to the encoder s input
