A circuit containing resistance is called an RLC circuit A simple circuit only has one RLC series With a resistance R present the total electromagnetic energy U of the circuit is no longer constant Instead it decreases with time as energy is transferred to thermal energy in the resistance Because of this loss of energy the oscillations of charge current and potential difference continuously decrease in amplitude and the oscillations are said to be damped They are damped in exactly the same way as those of the damped block spring oscillator To analyze the oscillations of this circuit an equation can be written for the total electromagnetic energy in the circuit at any instant This is because the resistance does not store electromagnetic energy However this total energy decreases as energy is transferred to thermal energy where the minus sign indicates that decreases By differentiating Eq with respect to time and then substituting the result in Eq the following is obtained Substituting the following is obtained
