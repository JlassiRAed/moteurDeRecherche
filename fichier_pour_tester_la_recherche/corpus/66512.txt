In computer science an instruction is a single operation of a central processing unit processor defined by the processor instruction set architecture instruction set The size or length of an instruction varies widely from as little as bit s in some microcontroller s to many as multiples of a byte s in some very long instruction word word size On traditional architectures an instruction includes an opcode specifying the operation to be performed such as add contents of memory to register and zero or more operand specifiers which may specify processor register registers memory locations or literal data The operand specifiers may have addressing mode s determining their meaning or may be in fixed fields In very long instruction word VLIW architectures which include many microcode architectures multiple simultaneous operations and operands are specified in a single instruction Instructions are rarely specified using their machine code form they may be specified by programmers using an assembly language or more commonly may be generated by compiler s There is another more general definition for an instruction not only related to the processor instruction set architecture instruction set which is An instruction may be any representation of an element of an executable computer program
