 Sterile neutrinos also known as neutral heavy leptons heavy neutrinos or right handed neutrinos are theoretical particles theoretical particle s that are extremely difficult to find This is because they are not affected by all of fundamental forces that rule normal physics only gravity They are detected by a theory called the seesaw mechanism which says that when sterile neutrinos are near other neutrino s they increase their own mass by lowering the mass of the nearby neutrinos Detection probably comes from the fact that they are affected by gravity
