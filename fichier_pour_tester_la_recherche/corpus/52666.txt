A fair catch is part of American football A receiver of a punt may signal for a fair catch when the ball is in the air To signal for it the receiver must wave one arm over his head from side to side Once he signals for it no one from the other team is allowed to touch him When the receiver catches the ball he may not run with it The play ends at that spot and his team takes possession where he caught it
