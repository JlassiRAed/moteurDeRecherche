 Mass spectrometry is a process that wikt measure measures the mass to charge ratio of ion charged particle s It is used to find out the mass of particles and to find the basic chemical element s in a sample or molecule It can also make clear the chemical structures of molecules such as peptide s and other chemical compound s It works by ionization ionizing the particles in the sample which means an electron is removed from each particle producing positively charged ions This is done by using an electron gun a high energy beam of electrons is passed through the sample to make electric ally charged particles or ion ions The ions are accelerated through a short tunnel by use of negatively charged plates to which the positively charged ions are attracted The first mass spectroscope was invented by the British physicist J J Thomson in His student Francis Aston developed the mass spectroscope for practical use
