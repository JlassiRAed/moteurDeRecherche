 Temnospondyls are an order order of small to giant amphibian tetrapod s They lived worldwide from the Carboniferous to the Triassic A few species continued into the Lower Cretaceous The Temnospondyls are similar or identical to the Labyrinthodont s minus the Lepospondyl s It is probably an evolutionary grade not monophyletic It is convenient to use because all these early amphibia were so different from present day amphibia Many in the early Permian looked more like reptile s because they were adapted to life in a drier climate Nevertheless they were amphibians and many larval stages have been found They are a large group of some family families and genera Fossil s have been found on every continent Their evolutionary history spans million years During this time they adapted to a wide range of habitat s including fresh water terrestrial and even coast al Marine biology marine environment s Fossils are known from the larva l stage metamorphosis and maturity Most temnospondyls were semiaquatic although some were almost fully terrestrial returning to the water only to breed These temnospondyls were some of the first vertebrates fully adapted to life on land Although temnospondyls are considered amphibians many had characteristics such as scales claws and armour like bony plates which modern amphibians do not have
