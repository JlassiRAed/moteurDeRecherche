 Excitation is a process to create a magnetic field from electric current This process is used in electric machines rotor spins in a magnetic field This magnetic field can come from a permanent magnet or field coils In the case of electric machine with field coils a current must flow to the coil to generate the magnetic field so that the field coils can act as a magnet like in the case of electric machine with permanent magnet The device in which excitation happens is called the exciter sci stub
