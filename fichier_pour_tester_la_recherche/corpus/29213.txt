A town is usually a place with a lot of houses but not a city As with cities there is more than one way to say what a town is in different countries In some places it is a kind of local government In English language English people also use the word town as a general word for places with a lot of houses Also going from the outside to central London is to go into town Generally the difference between towns and village s or hamlet The number of people who live in a place does not tell us if it is a town or a village In many areas of the world like India a big village can have many more people than a small town It is also difficult to say if a place is a town because today some towns are becoming bigger Sometimes a place is a city because it got the name city by law However people often call a place a town if it is small In the Middle Ages a place became a town by means of a charter which gave it town privileges
