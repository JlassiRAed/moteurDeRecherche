A boson is a particle which has a whole number spin A photon is an example of a boson as it has a spin spin of Bosons are different from fermion Fermions which are particles that make up matter because they obey Bose Einstein statistics Gauge boson s carry Force forces There are three known gauge bosons which are fundamental particle fundamental particles For example the photon carries the electromagnetism electromagnetic force The four gauge bosons are as follows photon s for electromagnetism gluon s for strong force and W and Z bosons for weak force Other Theoretical Particle theoretical gauge bosons are predicted such as graviton s for gravity The Higgs boson is another fundamental particle of a type called a scalar boson Paul Dirac named this class of particles bosons in honor of a famous scientist called Satyendra Nath Bose
