 The Dome of Florence Cathedral Florence Cathedral built by Arnolfo di Cambio had a huge hole at the centre The competition to build a roof over it was won by Brunelleschi who built the largest dome since Roman times He cleverly got the whole city excited by getting teams of workers from the eight parts of the city Church of San Lorenzo This church in Florence was designed by Brunelleschi using all the things he had learnt by looking at the architecture of Ancient Rome It has arches columns and round topped windows in the Roman style It looks completely different to the pointy arched churches of the Middle Ages Only the inside was finished The outside is still all rough bricks and no on knows exacly how it was meant to look On the inside however Brunelleschi taught everyone a new set of architectural rule that revolutionised The Renaissance Church of Sant Andrea When the Ancient Roman Emperors came back from winning a battle they built a Triumphal Arch as a monument to themself There are several of these monuments in Rome and they have the same design a big arch at the centre and a smaller lower arch or doorway on either side The architect Alberti used this as the design for the front of the church of Sant Andrea in Mantua He used the same pattern of tall and arched low and square all down the inside of the church as well This was copied by many other architects Medici Riccardi Palace When it came to building palaces the rich people of the Renaissance had different needs to the Roman Emperors so the architects had to use the rules to make a new sort of grand building These Renaissance palaces are usually three stories high and quite plain on the outside On the inside there is a courtyard surrounded by beautiful columns and windows Architects like Michelozzo who worked for Cosimo de Medici looked at the Roman Colisseum which is three stories high with rows of arches Saint Peter s Basilica The most famous church in Rome was the ancient Church that had been built over the grave of St Peter By it was falling down The Pope decided that instead of repairing it it should be pulled down and a brand new church should be built By the time it was finished lots of important artists had worked on the design including Michelangelo Raphael Bramante Maderna and Sangallo It was the first building to use huge columns called a giant order It has one of the most magnificent domes in the world It has been copied in many countries Villa Rotunda This country house was built by Palladio in It is a square building which looks the same from every side At the centre there is a dome On every side is a large porch like a Parthenon Greek temple It is such an elegant design that other architects used the same style which can be seen on churches houses and palaces including the White House category Architecture category Renaissance
