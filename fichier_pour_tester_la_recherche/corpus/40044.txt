A vector is a mathematical wikt object object that has a size called the magnitude and a direction For example a vector would be used to show the distance and direction something moved in If you ask for directions and a person says Walk one kilometer towards North that s a vector If he d say Walk one kilometer without showing a direction it would be a scalar We usually draw vectors as arrow s The length of the arrow is Proportionality proportional to the vector s magnitude The direction in which the arrow points is the vector s direction
