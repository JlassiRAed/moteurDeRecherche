The Indian subcontinent is a term mainly used for the geographic region surrounded by the Indian Ocean the Republic of India Afghanistan Pakistan Kashmir and few other countries The subcontinent was once part of Gondwana the ancient southern supercontinent Geologically the origin of the Himalayas is the impact of the Indian tectonic plate travelling northward at cm per year to slowly hit the Eurasian continent about million years ago About million years ago this fast moving plate had completely closed the Tethys Ocean The existence of the Tethys has been proved by sedimentary rock s settled on the ocean floor and the volcano es that fringed its edges Since these sediments were light they crumpled into mountain ranges rather than sank to the floor The Indian plate is still driving horizontally below the Tibetan Plateau which forces the plateau to move upwards The Indo Australian plate is still moving at mm per year and over the next million years it will travel about km into Asia About mm per year of the India Asia convergence is absorbed by fault thrusting along the Himalaya southern front This leads to the Himalayas rising by about mm per year making them geologically active The movement of the Indian plate into the Asian plate also leads to earthquake s from time to time
