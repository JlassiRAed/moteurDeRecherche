 Grand unification theory or GUT is a model forces electromagnetismBecause GUT models have more Space dimensions dimensions than currently known there has not been a single GUT Particle accelerator Particle accelerators like the Large Hadron Collider have been built to test these GUTs indirectly as it is too complex to observe effects on particles without them GUT was first proposed by researchers from CERN in the s The discovery of the Higgs Boson and other such recent discoveries will get scientists closer to knowing which GUT is correct and ultimately know the Theory of Everything This theory was given by Pakistani scientist Abdus Salam who won a Noble Prize for it
