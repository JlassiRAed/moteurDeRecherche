 Hatikvah or Our Hope written by Naphtali Imber Hatikvah uses only the first stanza and the refrain of Imber s poem The last line of the refrain was changed and the words were put to music The music is from a very old and very popular folk song that Samuel Cohen a Jew born in Spain found himself humming one day It is in a minor key which is usually not used for national anthems because it sounds sad but the words to the song are about the Jews hope that one day their sadness will be turned into joy
