 HOMO stands for highest occupied molecular orbital LUMO stands for lowest unoccupied molecular orbital The energy difference between the HOMO and LUMO is termed the HOMO LUMO gap HOMO and LUMO are sometimes referred to as frontier orbitals Each molecular orbital has a calculated energy level Chemists sort the molecular orbitals The difference in the HOMO s energy level and the LUMO s energy level is called the band gap The band gap can sometimes serve as a measure of the excitability of the molecule the smaller the energy the more easily a molecule s electrons will be excited For example this can help predict whether a substance will have luminescence
