In cryptography Triple DES is a block cipher created from the Data Encryption Standard When it was discovered that a bit key of DES is not enough to protect from brute force attack s TDES was chosen as a simple way to enlarge the key space without a need to switch to a new algorithm The use of three steps is essential to prevent meet in the middle attack s that are effective against double DES encryption In general TDES with three different keys Special Publication By design DES and therefore TDES suffer from slow performance in software which are many of the places it is still used TDES is slowly disappearing from use largely replaced by the Advanced Encryption Standard This guarantees that TDES will remain an active cryptographic standard well into the future
