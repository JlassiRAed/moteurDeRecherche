 Gaia is a space observatory It was launched by the European Space Agency on December It will study about of the Milky way population A successor to the Hipparcos mission it is part of ESA s Horizon Plus long term scientific program Gaia will monitor each of its target stars about times over a period of five years Gaia will create an extremely precise three dimensional map of stars throughout the Milky Way galaxy and map their motions This data is a product of the origin and subsequent evolution of the Milky Way The Astronomical spectroscopy spectroscopic measurements will find the physical properties of each star observed their luminosity temperature gravitation gravity and chemical element elemental composition The massive stellar census will provide the basic observational data With the data astronomers hope to tackle a range of important problems like the origin structure and evolutionary history of our galaxy Large numbers of quasar s galaxy galaxies extrasolar planet s and Solar System bodies will be measured at the same time Gaia is being launched using a Soyuz in French Guiana Lagrangian point
