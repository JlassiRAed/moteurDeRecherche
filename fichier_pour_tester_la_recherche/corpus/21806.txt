 Fluid mechanics is the study of how fluid s move and the Force Fluid mechanics can be divided into fluid statics the study of fluids at rest and fluid dynamics the study of fluids in motion It is a branch of continuum mechanics a subject which models matter without using the information that it is made out of atoms The study of fluid mechanics goes back at least to the days of ancient Greece when Archimedes made a beginning on fluid statics However fluid mechanics especially fluid dynamics is an active field of research with many unsolved or partly solved problems Fluid mechanics can be mathematically complex Sometimes it can best be solved by numerical analysis typically using computers A modern discipline called Computational Fluid Dynamics is devoted to this approach to solving fluid mechanics problems
