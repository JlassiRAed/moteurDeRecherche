Momentum can be considered the power when an object is moving meaning how much force it can have on another object For example a bowling ball of Indian subcontinent is very high As defined by Newton momentum of an object Momentum is sometimes referred to as linear momentum which is different from its related subject angular momentum Momentum is a conserved object meaning that the total initial momentum of a system must be equal to the total final momentum of a system Total amount of momentum remains unchanged
