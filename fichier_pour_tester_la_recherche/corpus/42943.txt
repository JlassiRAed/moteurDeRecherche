 Vorticity is a Mathematics mathematical concept used in fluid dynamics It can be related to the amount of Circulation in a fluid The average vorticity in a small region of fluid flow is equal to the Circulation circulation around the boundary of the small region divided by the area A of the small region Notionally the vorticity at a point in a fluid is the Limit of a function limit as the area of the small region of fluid approaches zero at the point Mathematically the vorticity at a point is a vector and is defined as the curl of the velocity vec omega vec nabla times vec v In the field of flow of a fluid vorticity is zero almost everywhere It is only in special places such as the boundary layer or the core of a vortex that the vorticity is not zero
