The Acarina or Acari are the mites and ticks They are an Order order of Arachnid s Their fossil history goes back to the Devonian era Most acarines are tiny less than a millimetre It is estimated that over species have been described but a million or more species may be currently living The study of mites and ticks is called acarology Acarines live in practically every Ecoregion habitat and include aquatic and terrestrial species They outnumber other arthropod s in the soil and detritus Many are parasitism parasitic and they affect both vertebrate s and invertebrate s Most parasitic forms are external parasites while the free living forms are generally predator s and may even be used to control undesirable arthropods Others help to break down forest litter and dead organic matter such as skin cells Others still are herbivorous and may damage crops Damage to crops is perhaps the most costly economic effect of mites especially by the spider mites and their relatives earth mites thread footed mites and the gall and rust mites Some parasitic forms affect humans and other mammal s causing damage by their feeding and can even be Vector vectors of diseases such as scrub typhus and rickettsia A well known effect of mites on humans is as an allergen which stimulates asthma Predatory mites may be used in pest control and herbivorous mites used to attack weed s A positive contribution of the Acari is their normal functioning in ecosystem s especially their roles in the decomposer subsystem
