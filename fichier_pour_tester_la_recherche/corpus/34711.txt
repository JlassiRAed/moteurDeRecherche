When you see letters mixed with numbers and arithmetic like x x there is a good chance that it is a polynomial Mathematicians scientists and engineers use polynomials to solve problems Polynomials are taught in algebra which is a gateway course to all technical subjects In algebra when you see letters numbers and arithmetic the understanding is that the letters stand either for numbers you do not know or for numbers that change during the course of the problem variable s such as time If the only arithmetic is addition subtraction multiplication and whole number exponent s then that mixture of letters numbers and arithmetic is called a polynomial If harder operations are used such as division or square roots then what you have is an algebraic expression A polynomial is an easy to use algebraic expression Polynomials are often used to form polynomial equation s such as x x
