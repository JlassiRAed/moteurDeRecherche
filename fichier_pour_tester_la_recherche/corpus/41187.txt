 Zero point energy is the energy of the vacuum space the space between the subatomic particle subatomic particles within atom atoms There are a few theories about how much energy there is in that space There is the theory that there is an incredibly small very near zero amount the theory that there is zero energy there the theory that the amount of energy is indeterminable and the theory that a cubic centimetre of vacuum has a few levels of magnitude more energy than would be required to create the Big Bang If you look at the way physics is going there are atom atoms then there are subatomic particle subatomic particles making up atoms and now there is string theory String theory says that those smallest subatomic particles are made of vibrating string s of energy and that those strings have practically no actual width whatsoever So all the matter of the universe could be compressed into an extremely small space hence the Big Bang theory If this is the case the large energy interpretation of zero point energy seems likely The term zero point comes from the cooling of helium to degrees kelvin Even at fractions below degree Kelvin the helium stays fluid with no signs of freezing
