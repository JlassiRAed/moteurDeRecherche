A glacial lake is a lake that is made as a glacier melts The glacier erodes the land and then as it melts water fills the hole or space that has been created Near the end of the last glacial period about years ago glaciers began to retreat Glacial lakes are often surrounded other evidence of the glacier including drumlins moraines esker s glacial striations striations and chatter mark s The glaciers crush minerals in the rock as they pass over them These minerals become sediment at the bottom of the lake and some of the rock flour becomes suspended in the water These minerals support a large population of algae making the water look green These lakes can be seen in aerial photos of landforms in The coastlines near these areas are often very irregular formed by the same geological process Other areas have fewer lakes that often are part of river systems Their coastlines are smoother These areas were carved more by erosion
