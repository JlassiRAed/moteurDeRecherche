A multiset that tells how many copies of a certain type of item there are in a certain multiset They call this multiplicity For example in the multiset a a b b b c the multiplicities of the members a b and c are respectively and A multiset is illustrated by means of a histogram A multiset can also be considered an unordered tuple The tuples are not equal either The multisets a b and b a are equal but the multisets a a and a are not equal The sets a b and b a are equal and the sets a a and a are equal too
