 Allotropy is when a chemical element can exist in two or more different forms in the same physical State of matter state or phase These different forms are called allotropes Therefore an allotrope is a different structure in which an element appears This happens when the atoms of the element are chemical bond bonded together in a different way For example the allotropes of carbon include Only some elements have allotropes The term allotropy is used for elements only not for chemical compound compounds The more general term used for any crystalline material is Polymorphism these different states are not themselves considered examples of allotropy
