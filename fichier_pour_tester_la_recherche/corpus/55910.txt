In neurobiology lateral inhibition is the wikt ability ability of an excited neuron to reduce the activity of its neighbors It stops action potentials from spreading in the wikt lateral lateral direction It is called lateral inhibition as it stops neighboring neurons from firing This creates a contrast in stimulation This increases perception For example in vision it helps in wikt differentiate differentiating edges It occurs primarily in visual processes But it has also been seen in tactile Auditory system auditory and even olfactory processing
