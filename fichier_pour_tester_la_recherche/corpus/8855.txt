Every force has a coupling constant which is a Measurement measure of its Intensity dynamics When physicists study the Quantum electrodynamics quantum behaviour of electromagnetism they can not solve the whole theory exactly because every particle may emit and absorb many other particles which may also do the same endlessly So events of emission and absorption are considered as Perturbation theory perturbations and are dealt with by a series of approximation s This also can happen in string theory String theories have a coupling constant It determines the probability that a dimensional string of energy will separate into two separate energy strings But unlike in particle theories the string coupling constant is not just a number but depends on one of the oscillation modes of the string physics stub
