 Wind is the flow of gas es On Earth wind is mostly the movement of air In outer space solar wind is the movement of gases or particle s from the sun through space The strongest winds seen on a planet in our solar system are on Neptune Saturn Short bursts of fast winds are called gusts Strong winds that go on for about one minute are called squalls Winds that go on for a long time are called many different things such as breeze gale tropical cyclone hurricane and typhoon Wind can move land especially in desert s Cold wind can sometimes have a bad effect on livestock Wind also affects animals food stores their hunting and the way they protect themselves Sunlight drives the Earth s atmospheric circulation The resulting winds blow over land and sea producing weather If there is a high pressure system This can damage house s and other building s and can also lead to death Wind can also be caused by the convection rising of hot air or the falling of cool air When hot air rises it creates a low pressure underneath it and air moves in to equalize the pressure When cold air drops it creates a high pressure and flows out to even out the pressure with the low pressure around it The wind is usually invisible but rain dust or snow can show how it is blowing A weathervane can also show you where the wind is coming from The Beaufort scale is a way to tell how strong the wind is It is used at sea when no land can be seen The increase in wind causes an increase in the rate of evaporation
