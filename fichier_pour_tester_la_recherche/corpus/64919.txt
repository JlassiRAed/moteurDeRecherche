 A fly order of advanced flying insects Their most obvious distinction from other insects is in their flight A typical fly has two flight wings on its thorax and a pair of halteres The halteres which evolved from the hind wings act as flight sensors they are balance organs Also flies have large eyes with excellent wide angle vision With the help of their eyes and halteres flies are exceptional fliers They can avoid most predators and are the most difficult insects to capture by hand Their jinks dives and turns to avoid their predators is their main adaptation The only other order of insects bearing two true functional wings plus any form of halteres are the Strepsiptera a small order of insects In contrast to the flies the Strepsiptera evolved their halteres from their front wings and their flight wings are their rear wings The presence of a single pair of wings distinguishes true flies from other insects with fly in their name such as mayfly mayflies dragonfly dragonflies damselfly damselflies stonefly stoneflies whitefly whiteflies firefly fireflies sawfly sawflies caddisfly caddisflies butterfly butterflies or scorpionfly scorpionflies Some true flies have become secondarily wingless including some that live in social insect Colony colonies Flies are also holometabolous with complete metamorphosis
