 Kessler Syndrome is a thought up situation made by the NASA scientist Donald J Kessler in which the amount of space debris in orbit is large enough to cause space collisions to happen often This would make space mostly unusable for years if it happened at an extreme level There is a satellite satellite in orbit that is large and inactive making it count as space debris but it is in an orbit with a large amount of space debris Two known objects get within m of it every year This could cause a lot of space debris inducing a domino effect with more collisions
