 Castorocauda lutrasimilis Castorocauda was a genus of small semi aquatic proto mammal s which lived in the Jurassic period about million years ago Its fossil was found in lake bed sediment s of the Daohugou Beds of Inner Mongolia Castorocauda was highly specialized with adaptations like those of modern semi aquatic mammals such as beaver s otter s and the platypus It is the earliest animal found with fur Castorocauda is one of the near mammals in a group called the Docodonta Although Castorocauda was not a crown group mammal it is important in the study of how mammals evolved It was the first find with an almost complete skeleton Also it is not a small nocturnal insectivore It was larger than most Mesozoic mammaliaform fossils It is the earliest absolutely certain evidence of hair and fur Previously the earliest was Eomaia a crown group mammal from about M years ago It had aquatic adaptations including flattened tail bones and remnants of soft tissue between the toes of the back feet suggesting that they were webbed Previously the earliest known semi aquatic mammaliaforms were from the Eocene about million years later Castorocauda s powerful forelimbs look adapted for digging This feature and the spurs on its ankles make it resemble the platypus which also swims and digs Its teeth look adapted for eating fish the first two molars had cusps in a straight row which made them more suitable for gripping and slicing than for grinding These molars are curved backwards which helps in grasping slippery prey
