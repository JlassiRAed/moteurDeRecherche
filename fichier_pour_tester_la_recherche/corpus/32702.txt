 Quantum teleportation is a way of transferring the quantum state of one quantum system to another using the entanglement quantum entanglement between two other systems For example let s assume Alice and Bob share an entangled pair of particles A and B and Alice wants to teleport the information of another message particle M to Bob What Alice does is interact her half of the entangled pair A she shares with Bob so that now the message particle M is entangled with Alice s other particle A Next Alice measures both of her particles A and M and tells what the outcomes of these measurements are to Bob Because the message particle M was entangled with Alice s other particle A and Bob has the information of Alice s measurements he can use this information to recreate the original message particle M out of the one he has B What makes quantum teleportation special is that we didn t need to physically move the message particle M from Alice to Bob
