A Gentile is a person who is not Jewish It is polite to use this word when needed to describe a person who is not Jewish as in my friend Robert is a Gentile Up until about a hundred years ago it was very hard for Jews and Gentiles to be close friends This is because they would be expected to ask each other over for dinner but Jews follow strict laws about what they can and cannot eat They can only eat what is kosher
