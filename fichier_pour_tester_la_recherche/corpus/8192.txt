The vertebrate brain is the main part of the central nervous system In vertebrate s the brain is at the front in the head It is protected by the skull and close to the main sense s of Visual perception vision Auditory system hearing equilibrioception balance gustation taste and olfaction smell As an animal moves forward its senses collect Information data about the surroundings and that data goes directly to the brain Brains are extremely complex The brain controls the other organ organs of the body either by activating muscle s or by causing secretion of chemicals such as hormone s and neurotransmitters Muscular action allows rapid and coordinated responses to changes in the environment hormones and the autonomic nervous system make slower changes in the body In vertebrates the spinal cord by itself can cause reflex responses as well as simple movement such as swimming or walking However sophisticated control of behaviour requires a centralized brain The structure of all vertebrate brains is basically the same At the same time during the course of evolution the vertebrate brain has undergone changes and become more effective In so called lower animals most or all of the brain structure is Genetics inherited and therefore their behaviour is mostly instinct ive In mammal s and especially in man the brain is developed further during life by learning This has the benefit of helping them fit better into their environment The capacity to learn is seen best in the cerebral cortex
