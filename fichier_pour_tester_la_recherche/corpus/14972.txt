 Dynamic programming is a method of solving problems which is used in computer science mathematics and economics Using this method a complex problem is split into simpler problems which are then solved At the end the solutions of the simpler problems are used to find the solution of the original complex problem Dynamic programming can be used in cases where it is possible to split a problem into smaller problems which are all quite similar Richard Bellman an US mathematician first used the term in the s when he wanted to solve problems in the field of Control theory He also stated what is now known as en Bellman equation Bellman s Principle of Optimality Bellman s Principle of Optimality quotation An optimal policy has the property that whatever the initial state andinitial decision are the remaining decisions must constitute an optimalpolicy with regard to the state resulting from the first decision Bellman
