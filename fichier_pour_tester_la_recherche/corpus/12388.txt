 Symmetric key algorithms are ways of doing cryptography where the Key key s for decryption and encryption are exactly the same shared secret You can generate the secret randomly from a password or through a secret key exchange procedure like Diffie Hellman key exchange Diffie Hellman Symmetric key algorithm s are very important because they are faster on computers than public key algorithms In public key cryptography also called asymmetric key cryptography it is hard to figure out the key for decryption from the key for encryption so you can tell the key for encryption to the public with no problem and everyone can send you secret messages This is very useful but public key cryptography algorithms are very slow on computers so they are actually only used to send a shared secret and then symmetric key algorithms are used for everything else because they are faster There are two kinds of symmetric key algorithms called stream cipher s and block cipher s Stream ciphers encrypt a message as a stream of bits one at a time Block ciphers take blocks of bits encrypt them as a single unit and sometimes use the answer later too Blocks of bits have been commonly used though modern cipher s like the Advanced Encryption Standard use bit blocks Examples of popular symmetric cypher s include Twofish Serpent Blowfish CAST RC Triple DES TDES and International Data Encryption Algorithm IDEA In history some symmetric ciphers were broken by cryptanalysis so it was less safe to use them for secrets Some attacks are called known plaintext attack s Chosen plaintext attack chosen plaintext attack s differential cryptanalysis and linear cryptanalysis Other terms for symmetric key encryption are secret key single key shared key one key and eventually private key encryption Make sure that the use of the latter term does not conflict with the term private key in public key cryptography
