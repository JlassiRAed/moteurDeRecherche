The Uncertainty principle is also called the Heisenberg uncertainty principle Werner Heisenberg wikt stumble stumbled on a secret of the universe No thing has a wikt definite definite wikt position position a definite wikt trajectory trajectory or a definite wikt momentum momentum Trying to pin a thing down to one definite position will make its momentum less well pinned down and wikt vice versa vice versa In wikt everyday everyday life we can wikt successfully successfully measure the position of an automobile at a wikt definite definite time and then measure its wikt direction direction and wikt speed speed in the next few wikt moments moments That is because the wikt uncertain uncertainties in position and velocity are so small that we could not wikt detect detect them We assume quite wikt correctly correctly that the wikt trajectory trajectory of the automobile will not be wikt noticeable noticeably changed when we drop a wikt marker marker on the ground and wikt click click a wikt stopwatch stopwatch at the same time to note the car s position in time and space We may bring that experience to the world of wikt atomic sized atomic sized wikt phenomenon phenomena and wikt incorrectly incorrectly assume that if we wikt measure measure the position of something like an wikt electron electron as it moves along its trajectory it will wikt continue continue to move along that same trajectory which we wikt imagine imagine we can then wikt accurate accurately wikt detect detect in the next few wikt moments moments We need to learn that the electron did not have a definite position before we Locating located it and that it also did not have a definite momentum before we measured the trajectory Moreover we may wikt justifiable justifiably assume that a wikt photon photon produced by a wikt laser laser aimed at a detection screen will hit very near to its wikt target target on that wikt screen screen and wikt confirm confirm this wikt predict prediction by any number of wikt experiment experiments Next we will discover that the more closely we try to pin down some location for the electron on its way toward the detection screen the more it and all others like it will be likely to miss that target So wikt pin pinning down a location for an electron makes the trajectory more indefinite indeterminate or uncertain If the trajectory were made more clear and then we were to try to locate that electron along an extension of the trajectory we just staked out then we would find that the more precise we made our knowledge of the trajectory the less likely we would be to find the electron where ordinary expectations would lead us to believe it to be If wikt pitcher pitchers threw electrons instead of baseballs and an overhead camera and side facing camera were placed somewhere between the pitcher s mound and home plate so that the exact position of the electron could be determined in mid flight then without the cameras being turned on the pitcher would throw straight balls and with the cameras turned on his wikt pitch pitches would start out straight but wikt gyrate gyrate wikt wild wildly after their pictures were taken The more clearly we know where the ball was wikt halfway halfway toward home place the more trouble the wikt batter batter will have in getting ready to hit it with his bat Unexpected wikt consequence consequences of the uncertainty feature of nature support our understanding of such things as nuclear fission the control of which gave wikt human humans a new and very powerful source of energy and quantum tunneling which is an operating principle of the wikt semiconductor semiconductors that are so important to modern computer and other wikt technology technologies In technical discussions one almost always talks about position and momentum Momentum is the product of velocity and mass and in physics the idea of velocity is the speed that something is going in a certain direction So sometimes one can also talk about the velocity of the thing in question and ignore its mass and sometimes it is wikt easy easier to understand things if we talk about the trajectory or path that something wikt follow follows That idea also wikt imnclude includes the ideas of speed and direction In the following diagrams we will show the main wikt feature features of uncertainty in concrete wikt term terms in the world of real things Later we will use a little wikt mathematics math to be able to give a clear idea of how much wikt wiggle wiggle room there is between position and momentum
