 Ageing is the changes that happen in an individual over time In humans ageing is several physical and psychological changes Senescence is the biological process which leads to ageing In one way ageing begins at birth because cell division and growth is fastest then and gradually slows down as time goes on In another way ageing starts when the likelihood of death increases Actuary Actuarial tables show the likelihood of death at each stage of life These tables are used by insurance companies to assess the rates of insurance on life policies and pension s It turns out that we are least likely to die when we are young adults For girls this is as early as The reason suggested by biologists is that this is the time most significant for reproduction or was in mankind s past A gene can be gene expression expressed at various stages of life Any allele of a gene which interfered with reproduction would have less chance of passing on to the next generation The number of such genes in the population would automatically be reduced Thus natural selection would virtually eliminate any inherited effect which reduced fertility However later in life inherited defects would have little or no effect on the population as a whole In fact during life our cells collect damage to their DNA which is random but causes us to become gradually less fit as we age And we have some cell types which never or rarely divide during adult life Muscle cells and most neurons never divide in adult life Obviously they collect damage and not just to the DNA Also we inherit various genetic conditions which have effect later in life like Huntington s chorea The twin effects of delayed heredity and buildup of damage is what makes us age Protists do not age they divide and the next generation is just as good as the last Why do even our dividing cells collect damage The answer to that question is not known
