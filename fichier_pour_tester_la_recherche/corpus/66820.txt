 Post hoc ergo propter hoc is a Latin phrase that literally translated means after this therefore because of this It is also called the post hoc fallacy It is a logical fallacy that happens when someone says event B happened after event A so event A must have caused event B It is different from the idea that correlation does not imply causation as in post hoc the assumption is made solely on the order of events rather than taking into account other factors that might rule out the connection An example is The rooster crows immediately before sunrise Therefore the rooster causes the sun to rise
