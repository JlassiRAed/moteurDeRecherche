The Norwegian Sea is a marginal sea in the North Atlantic Ocean northwest of Norway It is between the North Sea and the Greenland Sea It joins the North Atlantic Ocean to the west and the Barents Sea to the northeast In the southwest it is separated from the Atlantic Ocean by a submarine ridge running between Iceland and the Faroe Islands To the North the Jan Mayen Ridge separates it from the Greenland Sea Unlike many other seas most of the bottom of the Norwegian Sea is not part of a continental shelf It is at a great depth of about two kilometres on average Rich deposits of oil and natural gas are found under the sea bottom and are being explored commercially The coastal zones are rich in fish that visit the Norwegian Sea from the North Atlantic for Spawn spawning The warm North Atlantic Current gives stable and high water temperatures so that unlike the Arctic seas the Norwegian Sea is ice free throughout the year
