A probability density function is a function function that can be defined for any Continuous function continuous probability distribution The integral of the probability density function in the interval yields the probability that a given random variable with the given density is contained in the interval provided The probability density function is necessary to be able to work with continuous distributions Casting a dice will give the numbers to with a probability of but this is not a continuous function as only the numbers to are possible In contrast two people will not have the same height or the same weight Using a probability density function it is possible to determine the probability for people between even though there are infinitely many values between these two bounds
