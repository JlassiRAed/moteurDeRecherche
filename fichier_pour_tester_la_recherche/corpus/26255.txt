For this edition user Pmlinediter Pmlinediter interviewed user Barras Barras Ok so tell me about yourself where are you from and what do you do Well I m from Germany and and not really busy in real life at the moment That s the reason why I am so often around on IRC and on wiki When did you discover Wikipedia and how Oh that s a good question I first came to wikipedia work and decided to create an account on the German wikipedia When did you make your first edit With my account or as an IP With your account December Ok Tell me what you like most about Wikipedia I like to create articles But a very interesting part of Wikipedia is it to read articles That s the reason why I am very active on WP PGA PGA and WP PVGA PVGA which needs more help On this wiki what I like especially is that I can improve my English This would be hard on enwiki Agreed WP articles are very interesting to read Tell me what you like least about Wikipedia I don t like the useless dicussions which are a waste of time Sometimes discussions are helpful for the encyclopaedia but mostly they aren t I think some users should spend more time in helping in the main namespace rather than discussing how bad or good something is Anything in particular that you would like to change on Wikipedia I think sometimes that we should work more on articles rather than getting more users with more rights which are mostly not really needed I think this should be changed on simple And we should stop discussion about how and why we should do it and be WP BOLD bold Agreed discussions are long but we fail to do anything in reality That s true we discuss but don t change anything That is our main problem here Is there anything you want to say plug shout out to etc Well I think I said all So far not really Thanks for your interview Barras No problems You re welcome Well thanks for that Barras Look out for more QandA interviews in future editions August center
