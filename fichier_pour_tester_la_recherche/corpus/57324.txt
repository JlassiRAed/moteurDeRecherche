 Ignoratio elenchi Aristotle believed that an ignoratio elenchi is a mistake made by a questioner while attempting to falsify a respondent s argument He called it an ignorance of what makes for a refutation For Aristotle ignoratio elenchi amounts to ignorance of logic In fact Aristotle goes so far as to say that all logical fallacies can be reduced to what he calls ignoratio elenchi Modern use limits this term much more narrowly to the kind of mistake described in the first paragraph above
