 Von Neumann architecture or the von Neumann model is an early computer design description It was written by mathematician and physicist John von Neumann and others in the First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC von Neumann John First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC It describes a design of an electronic digital computer There are subsections of a processing unit with an arithmetic logic unit processor registers a control unit with an instruction register and program counter memory to store data and instructions and input and output devices This means a stored program computer It has an instruction fetch the step getting the instruction from memory and a data operation the instruction actually happening These cannot be done at the same time because they use the same bus bus This limit is called the von Neumann bottleneck
