A rotary evaporator cite bookThe liquid is put in a round bottomed flask and placed in the device The rotavap spins and heats the flask and reduces the pressure inside by creating a vacuum The vacuum makes the liquid evaporate at a low temperature than normal The liquid becomes a gas and is collected by cooling it so it condensation condenses into another flask If there are substances dissolution dissolved in the liquid they will be left behind in when it evaporates If water with salt dissolved in it is evaporated then pure water and dry salt will be separated Scientists use rotary evaporators to remove the liquid a solid is dissolved in Rotary evaporators are often quicker to use than evaporating basin s They can be used for distillation s
