The thermal efficiency is a Dimensionless quantity dimensionless performance measure of a thermal device such as an internal combustion engine a boiler or a furnace for example The input From the first and second law of thermodynamics the output can not exceed what is input soWhen expressed as a percentage the thermal efficiency must be between and Due to inefficiencies such as friction heat loss and other factors thermal efficiencies are typically much less than For example a typical gasoline automobile engine operates at around thermal efficiency and a large coal fueled electrical generating plant peaks at about In a combined cycle plant thermal efficiencies are approaching
