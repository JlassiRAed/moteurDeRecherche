If you can count the things in a set it is called a countable set A set with one thing in it is countable and so is a set with one hundred things in it A set with all the natural number s in it is countable too It s infinite but if someone counted forever they wouldn t miss any of the numbers Sometimes when people say countable set they mean countable and infinite Georg Cantor coined the term
