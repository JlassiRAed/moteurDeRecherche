 Gamma rays are electromagnetic waves with the smallest wavelength s in the electromagnetic spectrum They were discovered in by Paul Villard and named in by Ernest Rutherford Gamma rays are like x rays but the waves are smaller in wavelength Both gamma rays and x rays are photons with very high energies and gamma have even more energy They are also a type of ionizing radiation Gamma rays can travel through thicker materials than x rays can Gamma rays are produced by some types of radioactive atom s Cobalt and potassium are two isotopes that emit gamma rays Cobalt is created in accelerators and is used in hospitals Potassium occurs naturally Small amounts of potassium are in all plants and animals Gamma rays from potassium each have an energy of thousand electron volt s Gamma rays and X rays can also be distinguished by their origin X rays are emitted by electron s outside the Nucleus nucleus while gamma rays are emitted by the nucleus
