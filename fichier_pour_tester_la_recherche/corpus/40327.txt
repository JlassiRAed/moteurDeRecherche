 Ventricular tachycardia The top two are called the atria and the bottom two are called the ventricles When the Heart Structure heart is working normally electrical signals in the heart tell the to atria squeeze first However in ventricular tachycardia the ventricles squeeze first This happens because the electrical signals that tell the atria to squeeze first are not working Ventricular tachycardia is a medical emergency First of all if the heart is beating too fast it does not have time to refill with blood between beats This means that the heart will not be able to squeeze out enough blood to the rest of the body Most people in ventricular tachycardia have a heart rate of at least beats per minute This is very fast Ventricular tachycardia can also cause hypotension low blood pressure If the blood pressure gets low enough important parts of the body like the brain will not get enough blood and oxygen to survive Ventricular tachycardia can also lead to ventricular fibrillation asystole and sudden cardiac death sudden death
