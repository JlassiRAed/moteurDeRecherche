 Cantor s diagonal argument is a mathematical method to prove that two infinite sets have the same cardinality According to Cantor two sets have the same cardinality if it is possible to associate an element from the second set to each element of the first set and to associate an element of the first set to each element of the second set This statement works well for sets with a Finite set finite number of elements It is less intuitive for sets with an infinite number of elements
