MOSFET stands for metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor Transistor s are small electrical devices that are used in amongst other things alarm clocks calculators and perhaps most famously computer s they are some of the most basic building blocks of modern electronics A few MOSFETs amplify or process analog signal s Most are used in digital electronics MOSFETs act like valve s for electricity They have one input connection Said another way the gate acts as a switch that controls the two outputs Think of a dimmable light switch the knob itself selects ON OFF or somewhere in between controlling the brightness of the light Think of a MOSFET in place of the light switch the switch itself is the gate the source is the power coming into the house and the drain is the light bulb The name MOSFET describes the structure and the function of the transistor MOS refers to the fact that a MOSFET is built by layering metal electric signal is sent to the gate which creates an electric field that alters the connection between the source and drain Almost all MOSFETs are used in integrated circuit s As of it is possible to fit transistors on a single integrated circuit In that number was around
