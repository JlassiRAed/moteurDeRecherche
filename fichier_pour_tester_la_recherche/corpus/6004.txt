 Pierre Simon de Laplace used an operator in order to be able to model the movement of stars This operator later named Laplace operator is used on function functions of scalar s The Laplace operator which is also called scalar Laplacian applies to scalar field s and returns a scalar quantity The Vector Laplacian applies to the vector field vector fields and returns a vector quantity When computed in rectangular Cartesian coordinate system Cartesian coordinates the returned vector field is equal to the vector field of the scalar Laplacian applied on the individual elements In physics the Vector Laplacian is commonly used for the wave equation wave equations that are used to model Electromagnetic field electromagnetic fields
