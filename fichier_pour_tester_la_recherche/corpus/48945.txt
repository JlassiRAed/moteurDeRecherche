In mathematics an algebraic structure is a set with one two or more binary operation s on it The basic algebraic structures with one binary operation are the following Magma A set with a binary operation Semigroup A set with an operation which is associative Monoid A semigroup with an identity element Group Group A monoid where each element has a corresponding inverse element Commutative group A group with a commutative operationThe basic algebraic structures with two binary operations are the following Ring Ring A set with two operations often called addition and multiplication The set with the operation of addition forms a commutative group and with the operation of multiplication it forms a semigroup Addition and multiplication in a ring satisfy the distributive property Commutative ring A ring whose multiplication is commutative Field Field A commutative ring where the set with multiplication is a group Examples are The whole numbers is a monoid but is not a group The integer s with addition is a commutative group but with multiplication is just a monoid The integers with addition and multiplication is a commutative ring but not a field The rational number s the real number s and the complex number s with the ordinary addition and ordinary multiplication are fields
