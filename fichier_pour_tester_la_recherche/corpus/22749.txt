In photography the word normal lens is used for camera lens es that have a focal length which is roughly the diagonal of the image projected inside the camera Camera lenses with a shorter focal length are called wide angle lens es those with a longer one telephoto lens es This gives a natural perspective In Digital photography the situation is more complex The sensor type diameter is not the sensor diameter refers to tv tube diameters that were standards in the s The normal lens focal length is roughly of the TV tube diameter this is a mathematical calculation because most of the cameras have zoom lenses In cinematography a focal length roughly equivalent to twice the diagonal of the image projected within the camera is considered normal
