In chemistry a conjugated system is a system of connected p orbital s with delocalized electron s Conjugated systems are created by several multiple bonds each separated by single bonds In general conjugated systems may lower the overall energy of the molecule and increase how steady it is They can contain lone pair s radical Molecules which have a conjugated system have unique properties different from normal compounds created by the sharing of the delocalized electrons among many atoms Conjugation is the overlap of one p orbital with another across a sigma bond A conjugated system has a region of overlapping p orbitals bridging the single bonds that are between They allow a delocalization of pi electrons across all the adjacent aligned p orbitals The pi electron s do not belong to a single bond or atom but rather to a group of atoms The largest conjugated systems are in graphite conductive polymer s and carbon nanotube s
