The strong interaction metres long Scientists often divide it into two parts the colour force and nuclear force At distances of fm and less the colour force is responsible for holding Subatomic particle subatomic particles like protons and Neutron neutrons together At distances of to fm the nuclear force binds subatomic particles into Atomic nucleus atom nuclei The strong interaction is often thought to be controlled by Gluon gluons which glue quarks together through the strong force Gluons can be exchanged between quarks antiquarks and other gluons All of those particles are said to carry a colour charge a property of Elementary particle elementary particles which is like electric charge Particles with colour charge exchange gluons like how particles with electric charge exchange electrons In the theory of quantum chromodynamics the strong force is the wikt interaction interactions between quark s and gluon s Quantum chromodynamics is the theory that explains different colours The strong force is the fundamental force basic force controlled by gluon s affecting quarks antiparticle antiquarks and the gluons themselves The strong force only affects Quark quarks directly Between hadron s the strong force is known as the nuclear force The strong force is the reason why we can t see free Quark quarks i e quarks that are by themselves This event is called colour confinement a theory which says you can only see hadrons TOC
