 Fortran is a programming language first created in the s It is still in use today It is a procedural language mainly used for scientific computing and numerical analysis The first FORTRAN compiler was created in by a team at IBM led by John W Backus This compiler was the first compiler for any High level language The authors were worried that no one would use the language if programs written in it did not run nearly as fast as programs written in assembly language So they made it an optimizing compiler Because of the heavy use by scientists doing numerical work the language grew in ways that encouraged compiler writers to produce compilers that generated high quality code There are many high performance compiler vendors Much work and research in compiler theory and design was caused by the need to generate good code for Fortran programs Several revisions of the language have appeared including the very well known FORTRAN IV FORTRAN and Fortran The most recent formal standard for the language was published in and is known as Fortran Initially the language relied on precise formatting of the source code and heavy use of statement numbers and goto statements Every version introduced modern programming concepts such as source code comments and output of text IF THEN ELSE and parallel constructs while trying to maintain Fortran s lean profile and high performance
