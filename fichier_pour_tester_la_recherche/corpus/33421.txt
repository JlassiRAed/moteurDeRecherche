 Operant conditioning is a form of learning In it an individual changes its behaviour because of the wikt consequence consequences of the behaviour The person or animal learns its behaviour has a wikt consequence consequence That consequence may be Reinforcement a positive or reward ing event This causes the behaviour to occur more often Punishment a negative or Punishment punishing event This causes the behaviour to occur less often Extinction no event follows so the behaviour has no consequences When a behaviour has no consequences it will occur less frequently There are four different contexts in operant conditioning Here the terms positive and negative are not used in their basic sense positive means that something is added and negative means something is taken away Positive reinforcement occurs when there is a reward for a form of behaviour This will increase the frequency at which the behaviour occurs In the Skinner box experiment the reward is in the form of food when the rat presses a lever Negative reinforcement occurs when an aversive stimulus is removed This will increase the frequency at which the behaviour occurs In the Skinner box experiment there was a loud noise which was removed when the rat pressed the lever Positive punishment occurs when a stimulus is added which results in the behaviour occurring less often Example stimuli may be loud noise electric shock Negative punishment occurs when a stimulus is taken away which results in the behaviour occurring less often An example might be a child s toy taken away after the child does an undesired behaviour The idea of operant conditioning was first discovered by Edward Thorndike and analyzed by B F Skinner Operant conditioning is different from Pavlov s classical conditioning Operant conditioning deals with the voluntary modification of behaviour classical conditioning with training a reflex
