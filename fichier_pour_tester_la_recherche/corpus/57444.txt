 Orbital resonance is when two orbit ing bodies exert a regular periodic gravitational effect on each other Their orbital period s may be related by a ratio of two small integers It is caused by the changing gravitational force s of bodies which go round each other The stability of the Solar System was first investigated by Laplace and there is still much that is not known about it As a satellite satellite goes round a planet or two stars go round each other the gravitaional forces can change sometimes hugely This is partly because orbits are usually ellipse s not circular and so the forces change accordingly Also the planets and stars are usually not spherical They spin and vary in their degree of oblateness This also changes the forces on an orbiting body In particular the forces may be stability unstable so the smaller partner may change until the forces are stable There are other stability effects Gaps in Saturn s rings are caused by the particles shifting into more stable positions In the rings of Saturn the Cassini Division is a gap between the inner B Ring and the outer A Ring It was cleared by a resonance with the moon Mimas There is a stability ratio for Neptune and Pluto the ratio means Pluto completes two orbits in the time it takes Neptune to complete three The area of mechanics which is used for these studies is called celestial mechanics
