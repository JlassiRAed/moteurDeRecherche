In cryptography the avalanche effect refers to an attractive property of block cipher s and cryptographic hash function s algorithm s The avalanche effect is satisfied if The output changes significantly In quality block cipher s such a small change in either the key key or the plaintext should cause a strong change in the ciphertext Both of above features allow small changes to propagate rapidly through iteration s of the algorithm in such a way that every bit of the output should depend on every bit of the input before the algorithm terminates The term avalanche effect was first used by Horst Feistel although the concept was identified by Confusion and diffusion Shannon s property of confusion If a block cipher or cryptographic hash function does not exhibit the avalanche effect to a significant degree then it has poor randomization and thus a cryptanalysis cryptanalyst can make Forecasting forecasts about the input if given only the output This may be sufficient to partially or completely break the algorithm One of the primary design objectives in constructing a quality cipher or cryptographic hash function is to build a good avalanche effect in it This is why most block ciphers are product cipher s It is also why hash functions have large data blocks
