In physics chemistry and biology intermolecular forces are forces that act between stable molecule s or between functional groups of macromolecule s These forces are generally much weaker than the chemical bond ing forces Their bonding energies are less than a few kcal mol But they are responsible for many different physical chemical and biological phenomena In general one distinguishes short and long range intermolecular forces
