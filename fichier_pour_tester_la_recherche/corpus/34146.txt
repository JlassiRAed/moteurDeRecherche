 Carbon steel or plain carbon steel is a metal alloy It is a combination of two elements iron and carbon Other elements are present in quantities too small to affect its properties The only other elements allowed in plain carbon steel are manganese Steel with a low carbon content has the same properties as iron soft but easily formed As carbon content rises the metal becomes harder and stronger but less ductile and more difficult to welding weld Higher carbon content lowers steel s melting point and its temperature resistance in general
