A saprophyte or saprotroph is an organism which gets its energy from dead organic matter This may be decaying pieces of plants or animals This means that saprophytes are heterotroph s They are consumers in the food chain This is the typical life style of fungi Some fungi are parasites on living organisms but most are saprophytes Many bacteria and protozoa are also saprophytes To put it simply most dead organic matter is eventually broken down and used by bacteria and fungi Lastly slime moulds are also saprophytes as well as consuming bacteria Other terms such as saprotroph or saprobe may be used instead of saprophyte Strictly speaking phyte means plant The problem is that no embryophytes are true saprotrophs and bacteria and fungi are no longer considered plants Nevertheless saprophyte is such a well known term that most writers continue to use it Saprophytes secrete digestive enzymes to get nutrients and energy
