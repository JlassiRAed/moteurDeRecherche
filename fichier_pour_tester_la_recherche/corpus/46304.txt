 Protein folding is the process by which a protein gets its function al shape or conformation It is mainly a self organising process The structure is held together by hydrogen bonds The stages are Each protein exists as an unfolded polypeptide or random coil when translated from a sequence of mRNA to a linear chain of amino acid s This polypeptide lacks any developed three dimensional structure Amino acids interact with each other to produce a well defined protein structure three dimensional structure the folded protein Without its correct three dimensional structure a protein does not work However some parts of proteins may not fold this is normal cite book If proteins do not fold into their native shape they are inactive and are usually toxic Several disease s are believed to result from misfolded proteins
