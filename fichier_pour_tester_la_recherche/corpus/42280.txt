A chemical equation is a way to predict the way that two or more chemical s will work together Using what chemist s know about the way chemicals act we add the letter symbol s together just like a math problem In this way we can correctly guess if we will get a new chemical when we mix two or more chemicals together and what that chemical will be Chemical equations are either worded or written using the elements symbols how much of the chemical element element and in what state it is in For example An aqueous solution of sodium chloride Which in symbols is NaClThe solutions formed the solid AgCl This formation can be called a Chemical precipitation precipitate and the reaction between the two solutions a precipitation reaction because the solid produced is not dissolved whereas all the other products are dissolved
