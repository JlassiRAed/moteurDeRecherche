 The British Rail Class was the first production model of the Pacer Pacer diesel multiple units They were created because then British Rail had a large shortage of trains so rather than spending lots of money on expensive proper trains they invented the Pacer British Leyland at the time had a surplus in the production of bus bodies so the idea was to weld the bus body from an old bus on to a freight waggon chassis The result of this was that pacers have notoriously poor suspension and are noisier around corners due to flanging by new trains
