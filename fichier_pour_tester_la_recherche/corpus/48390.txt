The Highland Boundary Fault is a Fault The geological history of Scotland can be understood as the result of two great tectonic events The first was the formation of the global super continent Pangaea the second was the break up of Pangaea to form the continents we know today The fault is the middle of three great faults which run south east to north west across Scotland In the north there is the Great Glen Fault and in the south the Southern Uplands Fault Further south just over the border with England is the Iapetus Suture where the palaeo Iapetus Ocean closed These four major geological signs mark the ancient history of Scotland The Highland Boundary Fault was active during the Caledonian orogeny This was a plate tectonics plate tectonic collision which took place from Mid Ordovician to Mid Devonian periods during the closure of the Iapetus Ocean The fault allowed the Central Lowlands Midland Valley to descend as a major rift rift by up to metres and there was subsequently vertical movement This movement was later replaced by a horizontal shear A complementary fault the Southern Uplands Fault forms the southern boundary for the Central Lowlands
