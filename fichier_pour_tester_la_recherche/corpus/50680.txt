The Great Attractor is a gigantic mass in space which pulls our Milky Way galaxy and many other galaxies towards it The Great Attractor is known by its effect on the movement of galaxies across hundreds of millions of light years Its mass is equivalent to the mass of tens of thousands of Milky Ways All the galaxies in the GA are redshift ed in accordance with the expansion of the Universe They are receding relative to us and to each other but the variations in their redshift show the existence of the Attractor The variations in their redshifts range from about km s to km s depending on where they are in relation to the Great Attractor
