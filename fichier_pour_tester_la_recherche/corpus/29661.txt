In mathematics the universe of discourse or domain of discourse is a set of all elements to which a function function applies A variable can take any of the values in its universe of discourse The term is also used informally In every discourse whether of the mind conversing with its own thoughts or of the individual in his intercourse with others there is an assumed or expressed limit within which the subjects of its operation are confined The most unfettered discourse is that in which the words we use are understood in the widest possible application and for them the limits of discourse are co extensive with those of the universe itself But more usually we confine ourselves to a less spacious field Sometimes in discoursing of men we imply that it is of men only under certain circumstances and conditions that we speak as of civilized men or of men in the vigour of life or of men under some other condition or relation Now whatever may be the extent of the field within which all the objects of our discourse are found that field may properly be termed the universe of discourse Furthermore this universe of discourse is in the strictest sense the ultimate subject of the discourse
