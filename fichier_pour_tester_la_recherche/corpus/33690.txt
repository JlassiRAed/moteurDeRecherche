A gravitational singularity is a term used to describe the center of a black hole where gravity is thought to approach infinity In the center of each black hole is a singularity a point where infinite density develops as spacetime approaches it Spacetime goes toward infinite curvature and matter is crushed to infinite density under the pull of infinite gravity At a singularity space and time cease to exist as we know them and current laws of physics cannot be applied to this region
