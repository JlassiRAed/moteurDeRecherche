 DNA replication is the process of copying a double stranded DNA molecule Both strands serve as templates for the reproduction of the opposite strand The process is sometimes called semi conservative replication because the daughter DNA from the original parent strand contains half of the original and half of the newly synthesized DNA This process occurs in all life forms with DNA There are some differences in the control of DNA replication in prokaryote prokaryotic and eukaryote eukaryotic organisms In a cell cell DNA replication begins at specific places in the genome called origins Chapter Section DNA Replication of both strands proceeds rapidly from specific start sites other enzyme s at the fork help to start and continue the DNA synthesis
