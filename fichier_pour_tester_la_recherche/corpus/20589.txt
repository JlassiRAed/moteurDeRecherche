 An alternator is a generator which converts mechanical energy to electrical energy in the form of alternating current There is one in every car Most alternators use a rotating magnetic field with a stationary armature The armature reacts to the rotating field and carries the current caused by the rotation In principle any alternating current AC electrical generator can be called an alternator but usually the term refers to small rotating machines driven by automotive and other internal combustion engines An alternator that uses a magnet permanent magnet for its magnetic field is called a magneto Alternators in power station s driven by steam turbine s are called turbo alternators
