The Lower Cretaceous is the first geology geological Epoch epoch in the Cretaceous It began million years ago and ended million years ago Lasting for about million years this is the longest stage in the Phanerozoic eon It is longer than some of the geological periods in the Phanerozoic The Lower Cretaceous is best displayed in England where it is composed of two series of rocks Between the two is a major rise in sea level Lower the Wealden Beds laid down in freshwater or brackish conditions Sand s came from the flood plain of a huge tropical braided river Clay s came from a coast al lagoon al plain Upper the Greensands an olive green sandstone deposited in the sea and the Gault Clay a formation of stiff blue clay deposited in a calm fairly deep water Ocean marine environment It overlays the Lower Greensand formation The two parts of the Cretaceous represent the sea level where the divisions were first defined In the Lower Cretaceous the sea level was much lower than in the Upper Cretaceous In the Wealden Southern England was a huge tropical river delta in the Greensand the same areas were just off shore However in the Upper Cretaceous the deposits were made in deeper water on what was then the continental shelf Sea level then stood at its highest level in the Mesozoic
