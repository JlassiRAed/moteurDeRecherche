 Plankton are drifting organism s that live in the surface layers of the ocean They live in the top layer of the ocean called the Pelagic zone epipelagic zone They are not strong enough to swim against ocean currents The term is in contrast to nekton who can control their movements There are three groups Plankton are important in the ocean s food chain They are the main source of food for almost all fish larvae as they switch from their yolk sacs to catching prey Basking shark s and blue whale s feed on them directly other large fish feed on them indirectly by eating fish of smaller size such as herring s The distribution of plankton is governed more by nutrients than by temperature Large tracts of ocean are blue and sterile The reason is that these areas lack one or more crucial nutrients for the photosynthetic plankton upon whom all the others depend Broadly speaking areas near land masses get nutrients by rivers and wind The key nutrient lacking in the Pacific ocean is iron essential in molecule s such as ferredoxins iron sulfur protein s which do electron transfer in a range of Metabolism metabolic reactions
