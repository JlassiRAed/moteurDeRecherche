 in Berlin on the Gendarmenmarkt across from the Neue Kirche Berlin Deutscher Dom formerly a church of German speaking congregants The first parts of the actual French Church were built from to for the Huguenot community At that time Huguenots made up about of Berlin s population The French Church was modelled after the destroyed Huguenot temple in Charenton Saint Maurice France In Carl von Gontard modified the church and built wall to wall next to it the domed tower which together with the French speaking congregants earned the church its naming The domed tower is technically no part of the church there is no access between church and tower because both buildings have different owners The tower similar to that of Deutscher Dom was simply built to give the Gendarmenmarkt a symmetric design The church is not a cathedral in the strict sense of the word because it has never been the seat of a bishop The domed tower which is a viewing platform open to visitors provides a panoramic view of Berlin A restaurant is located in the basement underneath the prayer hall The tower also contains the Huguenot museum of Berlin
