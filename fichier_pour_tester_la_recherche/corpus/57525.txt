 Hinge teeth are part of the inner surface of the shell of a bivalve mollusc Bivalves by definition have two valves edge of the shell In life the shell needs to be able to open slightly to allow the foot and siphon Like the ligament the hinge teeth are along the hinge line of the shell In most families the two valves of the shell are almost perfectly symmetrical with one another along the hinge line though the placement and shape of the teeth may differ slightly in the left valve and right valve so the two valves fit together properly Each group of bivalves tends to have distinctive hinge teeth Because of this examining the arrangement of the hinge teeth in a bivalve shell is often essential for identification and classification Carter Burt Invertebrate paleobiology on line syllabus on bivalves Georgia Southwestern State University
