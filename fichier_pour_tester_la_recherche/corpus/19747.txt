Below are the brightest individual star s in order of their average apparent magnitude s in the visible spectrum as seen from Earth To the naked eye on a clear dark night in a place far from cities and lights the total number of stars visible is about This is not the same as a list of the brightest stars as seen with the naked eye because close binary star binary or multiple star systems will appear as a single star brighter than their individual components The binary system Alpha Centauri Rigel Kentaurus has an apparent magnitude of but the brightest individual star is Alpha Centauri A with the apparent magnitude as listed here of Hence Alpha Centauri is the third brightest star in the night sky whilst its brightest component Alpha Centauri A is the fourth brightest individual star
