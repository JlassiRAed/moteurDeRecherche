A clothes dryer is a machine that is used to remove water from clothing after it is laundry washed A dryer is made of a rotating cylinder called a drum that holds clothes and lets hot air in to evaporation evaporate the water Then the heated air and water vapor exit through a vent The drum spins so that the clothing stays apart making the hot air work better Dryers can use electricity to both operate the machine and create heat to dry the clothes Others use natural gas to create the heat Ventless clothes dryers work differently since they cannot vent the hot air The water either goes down the drain or into a Storage tank collection tank
