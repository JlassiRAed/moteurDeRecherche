 Immortality or eternal life is the idea of something which is alive that will stay alive forever The opposite of immortality is mortality which means a living thing can death die Right now only a small number of living things are known to be immortal These are mainly simple lower forms of life like bacteria Stories about immortal people or animals are popular in fiction and mythology but not yet actually possible Many religion s say people have an immortal soul with an afterlife Some people have long used magic and science to look for a way to live forever Others feel that death is what defines all living things and as a natural part of life should not be taken away Insurance Actuary actuaries have calculated that even if everyone were physically immortal the average life span would still be only be years because of the accident rate eventually everyone would die of a fatal accident and it would be very unusual to encounter anyone more than years old Therefore it would seem that the only practical way to achieve actual immortality is to upload one s mind into a supercomputer to live in virtual reality Futurist s such as Ray Kurzweil believe this will become possible about the year in the technological singularity
