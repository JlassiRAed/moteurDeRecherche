 Tidal stream power is electricity made from the tidal movement of water A tidal stream generator is a machine that extracts energy from moving water in tide s Tidal stream generators draw energy from water currents in much the same way as wind turbine s draw energy from air currents Tidal stream power is the cheapest and the least ecologically damaging among the Tidal power Generating methods three main forms of tidal energy tidal power generation Tidal stream power is a relatively new technology It was first conceived in the s during the oil crisis The potential for power generation by an individual tidal turbine can be greater than that of similarly rated wind energy turbine Water is about times the density of air So water pushing against a turbine can provide much more power than air pushing against a similar turbine at the same speed Also the lowest water speeds needed for an economic power project is lower than the wind speed needed for a wind turbine project Surfing Energy s New Wave Time International June In practice the tide must move at speeds of at least knots even close to neap tide s to be a source of power As with wind power selection of location is critical for the tidal turbine Tidal stream systems need to be located in areas with fast currents where natural flows are concentrated between obstructions for example at the entrances to bays and rivers around rocky points headlands or between islands or other land masses
