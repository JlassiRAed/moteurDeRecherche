 Existence usually means the state or fact of being but there are many different views on the meaning of the word existence and what it means to exist In English language English existence is usually connected with the verb to be I am a human This is a pen The sky is blue Four plus three is seven The first sentence can be understood to say I exist as a human and simply speaking this is probably true The fourth sentence is more difficult to understand because it can be understood to say seven exists as the addition sum of four and three but seven is not something that we can see or touch like a pen or a human The question What is existence is a very important one for Philosophy philosophers and many people think Aristotle is the first human being to have thought seriously about the question
