 Symbiosis means living together It describes close and long term relationships between different species The term wasused by Albert Bernhard Frank to describe the wikt mutualistic mutualistic relationship in lichen s A symbiont is an organism living in a relationship with another species in which one or both get benefits When one species lives inside another species or a microscope microscopic symbiont lives inside the cell cells of a host it is called an endosymbiont The relevance of symbiosis is its frequency and its evolution ary significance There appear to be no higher plants or animals without symbionts Those symbionts are of great importance to the larger organisms who in most cases would be unable to live as they do without their symbionts Mycorrhiza in higher plants and gut flora in insects and vertebrate s are examples Humans are no exception Furthermore most of these associations are between organisms not just from different species but from different Kingdom kingdoms And lastly the cells of all eukaryote s contain organelle s which are descendants of symbiotic relationships which began at least a billion years ago Mitochondria and plastid s are examples The conclusion must be that symbiosis has been highly significant in the evolution of life
