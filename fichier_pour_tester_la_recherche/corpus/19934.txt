 Acritarchs are early micro fossil s the remains probably of eukaryote cells It is the resistant single layered cell walls or perhaps a cover secreted by cell walls that we see in early Rock These microfossils represent the resting stage in the reproductive cycle of eukaryote algae Acritarchs appear in quantity in organic rich shale s and silt stone strata to billion years old The increased spininess possibly resulted from the need for defence against predator s large enough to swallow them or tear them apart Other groups of small organisms from the Neo proterozoic era also show signs of anti predator defences Citation
