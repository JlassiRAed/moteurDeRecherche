 A higher pressure pushes Bernoulli saw that while the speed of the flow went up in the smaller part of the tube the pressure went down Please note that this refers to changes in speed and perssure along a single path of flow and does not apply to two different flows at different speeds Basically the Bernoulli principle says that as speed of the fluid increases pressure decreases The photo on the right shows this happening The air in the wide part of the tube has a higher static pressure than the thin part For a steady flow the amount of fluid entering the pipe must equal the amount leaving the pipe so the fluid speed in the thin part must increase The full version of Bernoulli s principle includes both the Mechanical work work performed by the pressure and by the changes in potential energy from changes in height In this form the principle says the sum of the pressure kinetic energy and potential energy is a conservation of energy constant
