 Chelation refers to the Chemical bond bonding of Chemical element elemental atom s that cannot normally be bonded For example Sodium is a metal element that can bond with many other elements like chlorine nucleus Sometimes these orbits are split into levels and only a certain number of electrons can fill each orbit before moving to a higher orbit Sometimes an orbit level is not filled all the way and can only be filled with electrons from another element with a smaller number of electrons in a higher level When the atoms bond together the electrons are traded between the two equally and create a very strong bond However there are a few elements that cannot bond with many other elements because they have orbits that are already filled or nearly filled equally Chelation enables a non bonding element to bond thereby enabling removal
