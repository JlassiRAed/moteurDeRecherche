The Big Weekend is an informal event held over a weekend that focuses editing on a particular topic The basic idea is to get a group of editors working together to increase and improve articles Being informal there is no need to register or to commit to anything You can do as much or as little as you have time for The topics for the Big Weekend are broad enough so that everyone can find something of interest to write about A Big Weekend needs to be long enough to allow editors from around the world to take part within their own time zones The times also need to be flexible enough to allow articles to be completed Experience from the first two Big Weekends showed that a time period of about five days was quite suitable The success of a Big Weekend can be measured by the number and quality of edits made to the target topic Other edits such as to relevant Wikipedia Template template s and Wikipedia Categories categories linking etc also add to the success of the weekend All relevant edits help so some editors may be part of a big weekend without even knowing At the moment the edits have been manually counted This was easy when the target was to create new articles much harder when it was adding to existing articles The adding of a code such as BW in the editing summary made the counting easier The focus needs to be on article creation and improvement not on lists or edit counts As there is no prize or glory a rough total count is fine to measure the success And one edit is one more than there was at the start so success is easy This Wikipedia talk Big Weekend article s talk page is a good place to plan the next Big Weekend
