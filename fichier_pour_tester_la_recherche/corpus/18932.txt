 Molecular cloning is a type of work in molecular biology It is used to assemble recombinant DNA molecules and to direct their DNA replication replication within Host host organisms Molecular cloning generally uses DNA sequences from two different organisms the species that is the source of the DNA to be cloned and the species that will serve as the living host for multiplying the recombinant DNA In a molecular cloning experiment the DNA to be cloned is got from an organism of interest then treated with enzymes in the test tube to get smaller DNA fragments These fragments are then joined with Vector This process takes advantage of the fact that a single bacterial cell can be induced to take up and replicate a single recombinant DNA molecule This single cell can then be expanded exponentially to generate a large amount of bacteria each of which contain copies of the original recombinant molecule Thus both the resulting bacterial population and the recombinant DNA molecule are commonly referred to as clones Strictly speaking recombinant DNA refers to DNA molecules while molecular cloning refers to the experimental methods used to assemble them
