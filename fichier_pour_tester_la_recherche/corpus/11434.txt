 By far the greater number of wasps are a special type of parasite They are parasitoid s which lay their eggs in or on the caterpillar s of other insect species Almost every insect Pest Parasitic wasps are increasingly used in agricultural pest control as they themselves do little or no damage to crops Farmers buy these parasitic wasps for insect control in their fields With most species the adult parasitic wasps themselves do not get any nutrients from their prey Much like bees butterfly butterflies and moth s those which do feed as adults usually get all of their nutrition from nectar Parasitic wasps are extremely varied in their habits Many lay their eggs in wikt inert inert stages of their host If the prey is a caterpillar they paralyze it by injecting it with Poison venom through their ovipositor Then they insert one or more eggs into the host or deposit them upon the host externally The host remains alive until the parasitoid larvae are mature dying later when the parasitoid s pupa te or when they emerge as adults Basically the hosts are eaten alive
