In ecology a biome is a major regional group of distinctive plant and animal community communities best adapted to the region s physical natural environment latitude elevation and topography terrain A biome is made up of ecoregion s or communities at stable steady state and all associated transitional disturbed or degraded vegetation fauna and soil s but can often be identified by the climax vegetation type The biodiversity characteristic of each biome especially the diversity of fauna and subdominant plant forms is a function of abiotic factors and the biomass productivity of the dominant vegetation Terrestrial biomes with higher net primary productivity Ecohydrology moisture availability and temperature A fundamental classification of biomes is into Terrestrial biomes and Aquatic biomes Biomes are often given local names For example a temperate grassland or shrubland biome is known commonly as steppe in central Asia savanna or veld in southern Africa prairie in North America pampa in South America and outback or scrubland scrub in Australia Sometimes an entire biome may be targeted for protection especially under an individual nation s Biodiversity Action Plan
