In physics pair production is what happens when a photon interacts with the Nucleus ionization ionizes until it combines with a free electron The two photons scatter in opposite directions The probability of pair production is proportional to the energy of the incoming photon and is affected by the material s atomic number Pair production usually happens with energy levels over Electronvolt MeV Pair production happens sometimes in radiation therapy treatments with high energy photon beams
