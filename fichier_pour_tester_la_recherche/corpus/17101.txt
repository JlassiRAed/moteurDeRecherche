A ballast tamper is a machine used to make Railway track railway tracks level It is like the railway version of a road roller apart from it lifts the track out of dips instead of squashing the parts where it is too high They make tamping quicker and the track is better than if tamping is done by hand Also some new track is too heavy to be lifted by hand so a tamper has to be used New tampers can also move the track from side to side to make it smoother
