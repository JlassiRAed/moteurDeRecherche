Many geometry geometric shape s of more than two dimension s are constructed by using regular two dimensional shapes That way a Tetrahedron is constructed with four triangle s a cube uses six square s In that context the shape that is used for construction is called base The triangle is the base of the tetrahedron and the square is the base of the cube Note that there are geometric figures that use different shapes A pyramid uses one rectangle and four triangles In that context the rectangle is said to be the base of the shape A cylinder uses a circle or an ellipse as a base
