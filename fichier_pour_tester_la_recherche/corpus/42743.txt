 Social democracy is an ideology that has the same values as socialism but in a different way The ideology supports a competitive economy with money while also helping people whose jobs don t pay a lot This makes it easier for people to support themselves in society by having more protection if they lose their job with an emphasis on equal rights for everyone and there is also plenty of either government ownership or regulation of various industries that make companies play by the government s rules This way of governing is appreciated by people living in countries who have to battle the cold more than others like the northern nordic countries of Sweden Denmark Finland Norway and Iceland The ideology s movement has seen some interest in other countries whose systems do not work this way because it has worked well for those who have it Despite a common belief that social democracy is socialist by principle its policies keep capitalism in place But the government has a focus on Keynesian economics where the government should step in and help people without jobs In social democracy entrepreneurs own the industries just like they would in a standard capitalist economy In socialism the workers own them instead which is very different
