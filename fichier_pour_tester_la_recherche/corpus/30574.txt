Note parent peak corresponding to molecular mass M A mass spectrum is an intensity versus m z in a sample It is a histogram usually made using an instrument called a mass spectrometer Not all mass spectra of a given substance are the same It can depend on the operating condition s of the instrument For example some mass spectrometers break the analyte molecules into many pieces others observe the wikt intact intact molecule molecular masses with little fragmentation A mass spectrum can represent many different types of information based on the type of mass spectrometer and the specific experiment however all wikt plot plot s of intensity vs mass to charge are called mass spectra Common fragmentation process es for organic compound organic molecule s are the McLafferty rearrangement and alpha cleavage In the past chemists with PhD degrees were needed to wikt interpret interpret mass spectra Today computer program s read the data and identify the Chemical compound compound s in a sample
