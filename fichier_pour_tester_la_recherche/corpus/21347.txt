In thermodynamics thermodynamic potentials are parameter s associated with a thermodynamic system and have the dimensions of energy They are called potentials because in a sense they describe the amount of potential energy in a thermodynamic system when it is subjected to certain constraints The different potentials correspond to different constraints to which the system may be subjected The four most common thermodynamic potentials are where T temperature S entropy p pressure V volume The Helmholtz free energy is often denoted by the symbol F but the use of A is preferred by IUPAC are also included as natural variables although they are sometimes ignored
