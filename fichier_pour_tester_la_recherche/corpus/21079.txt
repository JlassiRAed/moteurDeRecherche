 Radiation pressure is the pressure exerted upon any surface exposed to electromagnetic radiation If absorbed the pressure is the energy flux density divided by the speed of light If the radiation is totally reflected the radiation pressure is doubled This happens because the waves that make up electromagnetic radiation carry momentum with them and pass that momentum on when they reach a surface For example the radiation of the Sun at the Earth has an energy flux density of W m so the radiation pressure is Pascal
