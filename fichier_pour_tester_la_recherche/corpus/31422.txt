A vesicle is a bubble of liquid within a cell More technically a vesicle is a small intracellular membrane enclosed sac that stores or transports substances within a cell Vesicles form naturally because of the properties of lipid membrane s Vesicles can fuse with the plasma membrane and release their contents outside the cell Vesicles can also fuse with other organelle s within the cell A vesicle is sometimes formed when the cell is doing endocytosis Endocytosis is a process in which a cell s membrane takes in a particle from the outside and brings it inside the cell with a vesicle around it
