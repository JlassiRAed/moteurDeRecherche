A cathode ray is a stream of electrons that are seen in vacuum tubes It is called a cathode ray because the electrons are being emitted from the positive charged element in the vacuum tube called the cathode A cathode ray tube aims the ray at a point on its screen They were first observed in by German physicist Johann Hittorf and were named in by Eugen Goldstein Kathodenstrahlen or cathode rays Electrons were discovered as the constituents of cathode rays in by British physicist J J Thomson He showed the rays were composed of a previously unknown negatively charged particle which was later called the electron Cathode ray tube s use a focused beam of electrons deflected by electric or magnetic field s to create the image in a classic television set Some properties of cathode rays
