A floating point unit division and square root Some systems can also perform more advanced functions as Exponential function exponential or trigonometric function s calculations however in most modern processors these functions are done with software library routines not by hardware In most modern general purpose Central processing unit CPU s one or more FPUs are integrated inside the CPU however many Embedded system embedded microcontroller s especially older design s do not have hardware support for floating point operations In the past some systems as the Intel have implemented floating point via a coprocessor that is controlled by the Central processing unit CPU rather than as an integrated unit Most modern computers have integrated FPU hardware but not all In the absence of an FPU many FPU functions can be emulated which saves the added hardware cost of an FPU but is significantly slower
