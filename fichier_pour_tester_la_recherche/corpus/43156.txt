 Harmonic analysis is a branch of mathematics that looks at the theoretical foundations of digital signal processing A continuous signal can be drawn as a wave or as a combination of several waves Fourier transform s and Fourier series are among the main tools used for signal analysis Today this field has many uses which also include quantum mechanics and neuroscience In essence harmonic analysis looks at locally compact group s The Lebesgue measure is a way to assign a measurement to a subset of the Euclidean space For real number s there is the Haar measure which can perform this task This measure allows to use Fourier analysis to model the groups and their properties The term harmonics is also related to Eigenvalue s in the case where the frequency of one wave is an integer multiple of the frequency of another wave This is the case of the Harmonics harmonics that are used for music musical notes Later the term was generalized
