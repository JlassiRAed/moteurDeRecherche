The AIM Sidewinder is a short range air to air missile which means it is shot from an aircraft and is supposed to hit an aircraft It is heat seeking which means it locks on to heat It first flew in and went into air forces in It was used during the Vietnam War along with the AIM Sparrow but was not good At the time it would hit only of the time and could be fooled Sometimes it could lock on to the sun or other bogus heat source and not an enemy airplane The problems were later fixed and the new Sidewinders have a good hitting rate It is in a lot of air force s The missile can hit from miles It is used a lot
