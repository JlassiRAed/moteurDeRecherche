 Galaxy clusters are large collections of galaxies They consist of hundreds of galaxies and galaxy groups bound together by gravity Galaxy clusters are much larger than galaxy groups like our Local Group Clusters of galaxies should not be confused with either star cluster s which are inside galaxies or with globular cluster s which usually orbit galaxies Notable galaxy clusters in the relatively nearby universe include the Virgo Cluster Fornax Cluster Hercules Cluster and the Coma Cluster Still larger than galaxy clusters are superclusters A very large aggregation of galaxies known as the Great Attractor dominated by the Norma Cluster is massive enough to affect the local expansion of the universe Notable galaxy clusters in the distant high redshift universe include SPT CL J the most massive galaxy cluster ever found in the early universe
