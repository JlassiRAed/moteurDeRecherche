In geometry Sphere packing refers to a number of problems that try to arrange sphere s in space Very often the spheres all have the same size and the space used is usually three dimensional Euclidean space The problem is part of packing problem s When it is generalised not all the spheres need to have the same size and spaces can be n dimensional Euclidean space or hyperbolic space A typical sphere packing problem is to find an arrangement in which the spheres fill as large a proportion of the space as possible The proportion of space filled by the spheres is called the density of the arrangement As the local density of a packing in an infinite space can vary depending on the volume over which it is measured the problem is usually to maximise the average or asymptotic density measured over a large enough volume
