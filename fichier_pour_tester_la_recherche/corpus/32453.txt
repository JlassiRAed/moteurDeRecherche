 Control theory is an interdisciplinary branch of engineering and mathematics It deals with the behavior of dynamical system s The desired output of a system is called the reference In a control system a Controller is fed back to the input through the controller The controller then tells the input to turn off the power as the water is already boiling The system without the controller is called the open loop system When you add a controller in a feedback loop you create a closed loop system Open loop systems are rarely ever consider stable as they cannot be controlled Closed loop systems incorporate a controller or series of controllers which depending on the current output configure the input such that the output will have the desired response
