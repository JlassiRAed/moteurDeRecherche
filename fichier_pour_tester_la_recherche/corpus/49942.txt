 The Gram Schmidt process is a way of converting one set of vector s that forms a basis into another more friendly one Suppose we have a set of vectors we may make use of this observation to construct a general algorithm to convert an arbitrary basis into a friendly basis Like from our original set each time we use the process on a new vector it is guaranteed to be mutually friendly with all the previous vectors Define et cetera with the general term Should we wish to make this a friendly and cute v n
