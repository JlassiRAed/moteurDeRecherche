 Kinetic theory or kinetic theory of gases attempts to explain macroscopic overall properties of gas es such as pressure temperature or volume by considering their molecule molecular composition motion The theory basically states that pressure is not caused by molecules repulsion pushing each other away like earlier scientists thought Instead pressure is caused by the molecules colliding with each other and their container Kinetic theory is also known as kinetic molecular theory or collision theory There are three main components to kinetic theory
