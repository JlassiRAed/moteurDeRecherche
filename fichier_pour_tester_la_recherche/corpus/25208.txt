The African Plate is a major tectonic plate It includes much of the continent of Africa as well as oceanic crust which lies between the continent and various surrounding ocean ridges Since the continent of Africa includes both the African and the Somali plates some literature refers to the African Plate as the Nubian Plate to distinguish it from the continent as a whole Between million years ago rifting from the African Plate along the East African Rift One hypothesis suggests a mantle plume beneath the Afar Triangle Afar region Aother hypothesis suggests the rifting is just a zone of weakness as the plates to its east move northwards The African Plate s speed is about It has been moving over the past million years or so in a general northeast direction This is drawing it closer to the Eurasian Plate There is subduction where oceanic crust meets continental crust Along its northeast margin the African Plate is bounded by the Red Sea rift rift where the Arabian Plate is moving away from the African Plate The African Somali and Arabian Plates were once all part of the great Gondwana southern supercontinent as was the Indian subcontinent
