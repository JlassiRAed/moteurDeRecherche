 Clarel A Poem and Pilgrimage in the Holy Land is an epic poem by American writer and poet Herman Melville The poem ends with some words of hope for the hero Then keep thy heart though yet but ill resigned Clarel thy heart the issues there but mind That like the crocus budding through the snow That like a swimmer rising from the deep That like a burning secret which doth go Even from the bosom that would hoard and keep Emerge thou mayst from the last whelming sea And prove that death but routs life into victory Melville s poem was not much appreciated in th century In th century however it was called by Robert Penn Warren a precursor of The Waste Land In fact T S Eliot s poem is about seeking for faith too
