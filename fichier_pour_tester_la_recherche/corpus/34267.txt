The Droste Effect is the name for a picture which contains a smaller image of itself which in turn contains a smaller image of itself etc It is named after an advertisement It is an example of recursion In art this is known as mise en abyme In theory the recursion hoes on forever but in practice the number of recursions is limited by the resolution of the image In practice there are few iterations The reason for this is that this is a geometric progression and each iteration reduces the size of the image It is a visual example of a strange loop a self referential system of instancing which is the cornerstone of fractal geometry
