The equivalence relation is a relation subsets which are called equivalence classes As an example look at the animals on a farm We now define a relation we say that two animals are related if they belong to the same species That way a cow is related to an ox but not to a chicken The relation we just defined is an equivalence relation It is reflexive each animal is of the same species as itself It is symmetric if the cow is the same species than the ox then the ox is also the same species as the cow It is transitive if a cow and a bull and a bull and an ox are of the same species they are all of the same species of cattle In this example all cattle form an equivalence class
