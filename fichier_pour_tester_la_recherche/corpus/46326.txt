 Proper motion is the name for the way the star s seem to slowly move relative to each other when seen from Earth The movement is caused by the fact that all stars Proper motion was not proved to exist until when Edmond Halley noticed the stars Sirius Arcturus and Aldebaran had moved from the places they were in star charts that Hipparchus had drawn around BC However even after more than years they had moved less than half a Degree degree Proper motion is useful to astronomer s in figuring out how far away a star is from Earth because stars that are close usually have a larger proper motion than stars that are farther away For example Barnard s star has the largest proper motion of any star moving arcseconds per year This is equal to one quarter of a degree or half the diameter of the Moon in the sky in only years It is the second closest star to the Earth at light year s away Also eight of the ten stars with the biggest proper motions are less than light years away
