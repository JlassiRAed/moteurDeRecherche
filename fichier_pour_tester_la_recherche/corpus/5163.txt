 Hi Mikemoral thanks for answering some of my questions You re a long time editor who recently returned from a period of inactivity Tell us some more about yourself I started as an editor on English Wikipedia where I then started contributing to Simple I sadly moved away from Wikimedia for about four months I then started back contributing to Wikipedia and Wikinews and finally Simple What inspired you to contribute to Wikimedia and the Simple English Wikipedia Originally I contributed because of the many typos I saw on en wp I then moved into anti vandalism and I ve done lots of that I originally contributed to Simple to write an article Elizabeth Hay Countess of Erroll that I saved from deletion on en wp And of course improving this project What have been your most successful efforts so far On Simple I transwiki d a few articles I formed the User Mikemoral Typo Team typo team so that typos can be removed though it died away slightly I ve done a small amount of DYK and some anti vandalism This is a really tough question because some people might think my other contributions are more remarkable than these As a more occasional editor nowadays how do you think the project can improve A way to improve Simple is maybe to work on recruiting members so have a larger userbase to have maintain and improve Simple What are some good things about Simple Some of the good things about simple are it has a wikt moderate moderately large group of editors always willing to improve this project and it is a great wiki for ESL readers and children with a smaller vocabulary Anything else you d like to say while we re here I m glad to be back on Simple
