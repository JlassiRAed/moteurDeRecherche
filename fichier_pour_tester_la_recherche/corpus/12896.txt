 Up quarks are subatomic particle s that help make up many Composite particle larger particle s like proton s Up quarks have a Electromagnetism charge of and are the lightest of the six types spin of They are affected by all four of the fundamental force s which are gravity strong force weak force and electromagnetism Like all quarks Up quarks are elementary particle s which means that they are so small that scientists believe that they can not be divided any more Proton s are made of one up quark and two down quarks Up quarks can also be used to create more Meson complex particles such as pion s
