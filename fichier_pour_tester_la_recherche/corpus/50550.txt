 It was believed that this was a strange method of decay which is why the scientists gave the particles that name Strange quarks can be found in particles such as kaon s and some hyperon s Scientists began noticing strangeness when these particles did not decay as quickly as their masses would have suggested they would have However it took them a long time to even guess strangeness was the answer because it took over years to predict it after the discovery of kaons
