 Brentwood is a neighborhood in Northeast Washington D C It is named after the Brentwood Mansion built at Florida Avenue and th Street NE in by Robert Brent the first mayor of Washington City He built it as a wedding present for his daughter Eleanor and Congressman Joseph Pearson Brent gave them both the mansion and a large farm surrounding it Congressman Pearson also purchased additional properties and expanded the estate further The property then known as Brentwood was larger than the present On the web a small drawing of the mansion together with a brief description of its owners in Capt Mrs Carlile Pollock Patterson may be found in Washington Outside and Inside by George Alfred Townsend at page searchable as a google book Many people think that Benjamin Latrobe states that this is uncertain During the administration of President Ulysses S Grant Patterson Street N E which is adjacent to the property was probably named for the Patterson family C P Patterson a Naval officer and ship captain turned scientist and administrator of a government department had neither the interest nor the aptitude to manage the transformation of a large rural farming and forest property into an urbanized part of the city growing around it After C P Patterson s death in long delayed financial problems came to a head and on June three years after Patterson s death Congress enacted a private bill House bill No entitled An act for the relief of Eliza W Patterson C P Patterson s widow excusing accumulated District of Columbia property taxes on the Patterson land President Chester A Arthur neither signed nor vetoed the bill but held it ten days and allowed it to become law without his signature In a message dated June the President explained I do not question the constitutional right of Congress to pass a law relieving the family of an officer in view of the services he had rendered his country from the burdens of taxation but I submit to Congress that this just gift of the nation to the family of such faithful officer should come from the National Treasury rather than from that of this District and I therefore recommend that an appropriation be made to reimburse the District for the amount of taxes which would have been due to it had this act not become a law After five more years confusion in March Patterson s son in law Lt Francis Winslow The death of Francis Winslow s sons were officers in World War I and they may have staged in that camp on their own family land In the partially burnt house was finally demolished Part of the property became the first lumberyard for the building supply and hardware company Hechinger Co a store that was prominent in Washington into the s In the s Lt Winslow s son Francis Winslow ended his career as a mining engineer and took over active management of the Brentwood Patterson Winslow land His most notable achievement was the development of the Union Market For years called the Florida Avenue Market it still operates after years as the city s principal wholesale food and produce market Photographs and a detailed history of this development may be found in an April District of Columbia planning document the Florida Avenue Market Study at In the early s the District of Columbia used eminent domain to acquire a large parcel of the Patterson land known as square on which is being built as trustee asserting that the compensation offered by the District was inadequate Winslow won the suit and a judgment for a larger sum whereupon according to the family the District informed him that it simply didn t have the money to pay the larger judgment Regardless of payment or nonpayment title had vested in the government At about this time Winslow was demoralized by the death of his year old daughter in a car accident and was then diagnosed with cancer He died in His youngest brother Cameron an insurance executive in Hartford CT stepped in as trustee but it is unclear whether either Francis or Cameron ever received payment from the government of the court ordered price of square If not there may be the ironic situation of a government law enforcement agency headquarters located on land for which the government did not comply with the law by paying the lawful price Cameron Winslow determining that no one in the next generation appeared interested in managing the property and unable to manage the properties day to day from Hartford began selling all remaining parts of the property in the s completing the last of the sales in the s breaking up the landed estate that Robert Brent had assembled some years before Over the decades much of the land was acquired by or donated to Gallaudet University a prominent school for the deaf Cogswell Hall a residence hall of Gallaudet University is said to be built on the site of the old Brentwood Mansion According to a website on Washington ghost stories students have reported that it is haunted by the spirit of a little girl Allegedly blankets have
