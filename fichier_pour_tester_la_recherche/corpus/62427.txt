The atom s of a chemical element can exist in different types These are called isotopes They have the same number of proton s something has Things with different masses have different weight s Because different isotopes have different numbers of neutrons they do not all weigh the same or have the same mass Different isotopes of the same chemical element element have the same atomic number They have the same number of protons The atomic number is decided by the number of protons Isotopes have different mass number s though because they have different numbers of neutrons The word isotope meaning at the same place comes from the fact that isotopes are at the same place on the periodic table In a Neutral particle neutral atom the number of electron s equals the number of proton s Isotopes of the same element also have the same number of electrons and the electronic structure Because how an atom acts is decided by its electronic structure isotopes are almost the same chemically but different physically to their original atoms Heavier isotopes react chemically slower than lighter isotopes of the same element This mass effect is larger for protium because deuterium has twice the mass of protium For heavier elements the relative atomic weight ratio between isotopes is much less and the mass effect is usually small Atomic nuclei are protons and neutrons held together by the nuclear force Because protons are positively charged they repel each other Neutrons which are neutral stabilize the nucleus Because they are in the nucleus the protons are pushed slightly apart This reduces the electrostatic repulsion between the protons They still exert the attractive nuclear force on each other and on protons One or more neutrons are necessary for two or more protons to bind into a nucleus As the number of protons increases so does the number of neutrons needed to have a stable nucleus In nature some elements only have a single isotope For example fluorine F is the only isotope of fluorine Other elements have many isotopes For example xenon has isotopes Of the elements with a stable isotope the largest number of stable isotopes for any element is ten Some isotopes are radiation radioactive These are called radioactive isotopes Others are not radioactive These are called stable isotopes Hydrogen has three common isotopes The most common isotope of hydrogen is called protium Protium and deuterium are stable isotopes while tritium is a radioactive isotope The heaviest elements in the periodic table are all radioactive All of the isotopes of radon thorium and uranium are radioactive since they are very heavy This is because the nuclear forces inside the nucleus nucleus of the atom have a tough time holding together all the particle s with so many proton s and neutron s inside
