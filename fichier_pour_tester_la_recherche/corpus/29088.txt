In statistics a sample is part of a population population The sample is carefully chosen It should represent the whole population fairly without bias The reason samples are needed is that populations may be so large that counting all the individuals may not be possible or practical Therefore solving a problem in statistics usually starts with sampling Sampling is about choosing which Information data to take for later analysis As an example suppose the pollution of a lake should be analysed for a study Depending on where the samples of water were taken the studies can have different results As a general rule samples need to be random This means the chance or probability of selecting one individual is the same as the chance of selecting any other individual In practice random samples are always taken by means of a well defined wikt procedure procedure A procedure is a set of rule s a sequence of steps written down on paper and followed to the letter Even so some bias may remain in the sample Consider the problem of designing a sample to predict the result of an election wikt poll poll All known methods have their problems and the results of an election are often different from predictions based on a sample If you collect opinions by using telephones or by meeting people in the street the sample always has bias Therefore in cases like this a completely neutral sample is never possible In such cases a statistician will think about how to measure the amount of bias and there are ways to estimate this A similar situation occurs when scientists measure a physical property say the weight of a piece of metal or the speed of light If we weigh an object with sensitive wikt equipment equipment we will get minutely different results No system of measurement is ever perfect We get a series of estimates each one being a measurement These are samples with a certain degree of error Statistics is designed to describe error and carry out analysis on this kind of data There are different kinds of samples A complete sample includes all the elements that have a given property An unbiased or representative sample is produced by taking a complete sample and selecting elements from it in a process that does not depend on the properties of the elements
