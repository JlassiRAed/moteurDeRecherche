The chemical element s beyond uranium are radioactive and they do not have stable isotope s This means that they will decay into other elements Except for Plutonium their Half life half life is in the order of several minutes to seconds There is a theory in physics that says that after a number of elements with short half lives there will be others with longer half lives These are generally known as Islands of stability These elements are expected to have isotopes with half lives in the range of several minutes The hypothesis is that the atomic nucleus is built up in shells in a manner similar to the structure of the much larger electron shells in atoms In both cases shells are just groups of quantum energy level s that are relatively close to each other Energy levels from quantum states in two different shells will be separated by a relatively large energy gap So when the number of neutron s and proton s completely fills the energy level s of a given shell in the nucleus the binding energy per nucleon will reach a local maximum and thus that particular configuration will have a longer lifetime than nearby isotopes that do not possess filled shells A filled shell would have Magic number Recent research indicates that large nuclei are deformed causing magic numbers to shift Hassium is now believed to be a doubly magic deformed nucleus with deformed magic numbers and Isotopes have been produced with enough protons to plant them upon an island of stability but with too few neutrons to even place them upon the island s outer shores It is possible that these elements possess unusual chemical properties and if they have isotopes with adequate lifespans would be available for various practical applications File Periodic Table Radioactivity svg center px thumb Periodic table with elements colored according to the half life of their most stable isotope
