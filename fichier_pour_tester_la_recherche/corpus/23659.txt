 Collimated light is light whose ray rays are parallel and therefore will spread slowly as it propagates The word is related to collinear with all rays lining up In theory collimated light does not disperse with distance Really collimated light will disperse a little as it travels over distance Diffraction prevents scientists from creating a perfectly collimated beam with no beam divergence divergence Light can be roughly collimated by using a collimator a device which narrows a beam of particles or waves
