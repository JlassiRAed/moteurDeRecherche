A Web service is defined as a software system designed to support interoperable machine to machine interaction over a network Web services are frequently just Web API s that can be accessed over a network such as the Internet and executed on a remote system hosting the requested services The WC Web service definition encompasses many different systems but in common usage the term refers to clients and servers that communicate over the HTTP protocol used on the Web Such services tend to fall into one of two camps Big Web Services and RESTful Web Services Big Web Services use XML messages that follow the SOAP Some industry organizations such as the WS I mandate both SOAP and WSDL in their definition of a Web service More recently RESTful Web services have been regaining popularity particularly with Internet companies These also meet the WC definition and are often better integrated with HTTP than SOAP based services They do not require XML messages or WSDL service API definitions
