 Land reclamation is the idea of getting new land It is usually done in coast al areas Sometimes it is also done in areas like river s and lake s Usually there is a natural process which fills such areas with sand dirt and other materials Land reclamation uses the same process which is sped up In many cases this is done using Levee dikes An example where land reclamation is done is the IJsselmeer in the Netherlands Pioneer plants such as Salicornia or Ammophila Ammophila grow there When the level of the land is as high as that of the high tide new ditch es are dug and the process can repeat Sometimes it is too time consuming to wait for the land to rise In that case it is possible to pump out the water in the enclosed area This was done in the Netherlands where many areas are below sea level The problem with this approach is that it needs to be repeated for example in the case of heavy rainfall The creation of large artificial island s such as Palm Islands in Dubai or Maasvlakte which is part of the port of Rotterdam is not known as Land reclamation
