One of the problems that Wikipedia is most criticized for is that it is not always reliable This is true since anybody can change most articles and add anything they like Sometimes bad changes stay in place for a long time Wikipedia guidelines such as Wikipedia Verifiability and Wikipedia No original research and the additional restrictions for living people at Wikipedia Biographies of living persons have been made to help prevent this These guidelines are there for two reasons They help make sure that information which is added is true or at least that it is not made up on the spot They show us that a topic has received attention from other people and this helps show and argue WP N notability However many sources are not suitable for use in Wikipedia because they are not reliable This is a guideline about the types of sources which are reliable Wikipedia articles should use reliable third party published sources These sources can be in any language not just English or Simple English
