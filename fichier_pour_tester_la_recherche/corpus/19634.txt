 Hello and welcome to Wikipedia I do not want to seem unfriendly or make you feel unwelcome but I noticed and I am concerned that it might not meet Wikipedia s Wikipedia User page user page guideline After you have read that guideline could we discuss my concerns here I d like to hear your views such as why you want the current page and whether you might agree to change it to something else There are several ways we can deal with this matter If you can explain why your user page meets Wikipedia s user page guideline I can stop worrying about it If you decide to delete the page yourself please add to the top of your user page An Wikipedia Administrators administrator will then delete it If we can not agree on what needs to be done I can list your user page at Wikipedia Requests for deletion so that we can discuss with other editors whether the page should be kept or deleted noinclude
