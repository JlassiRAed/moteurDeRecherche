 Chemical kinetics also called reaction kinetics is studying how fast chemical reaction s go This includes studying how different conditions such as temperature pressure or solvent used affect the speed of a reaction Chemical kinetics can also be used to find out about reaction mechanism s and transition state s The basic idea of chemical kinetics is called collision theory This states that for a reaction to happen the molecule s must hit each other Ways of increasing the speed of the reaction must therefore increase the number of hits This can be done in many ways With experiments it is possible to calculate reaction rates from which you can get rate laws and rate constants A rate law is a mathematical expression with which you can calculate the speed of a reaction given the concentration of the reagents
