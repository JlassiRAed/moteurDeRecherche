 Bronchi are the large air tubes leading from the trachea to the lung s They carry air to the lungs The trachea At the alveoli oxygen from the air we breathe into our lungs is moved into the blood The blood then carries oxygen around to the rest of the body which needs oxygen to survive Without the bronchi air would never get into the lungs and oxygen would never get into our bodies The bronchi s walls are made of cartilage The right bronchus is shorter wider and straighter than the left bronchus
