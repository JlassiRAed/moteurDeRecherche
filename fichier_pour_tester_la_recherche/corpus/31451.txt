In cryptography a keystream is a Stream The characters in the keystream can be bit s byte s numbers or actual Character characters like A Z depending on the usage case Usually each character in the keystream is either added subtracted or Exclusive or XORed with a character in the plaintext to produce the ciphertext using modular arithmetic Keystreams are used in the one time pad cipher and in most stream cipher s Block cipher s can also be used to produce keystreams For example the CTR mode is a Block cipher modes of operation block mode that makes a block cipher produce a keystream then turns the block cipher into a stream cipher
