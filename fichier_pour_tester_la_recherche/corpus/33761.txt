A light emitting diode They can produce many different colors They are efficient most of the energy makes light not heat An LED is a type of diode that makes one color of light when electricity is sent through it in the expected direction This effect is a kind of electroluminescence The color of the light depends on the chemical composition of the semiconducting material used and can be near ultraviolet Visible light visible or infrared A white LED has either two or three LEDs inside of different colors Some white LEDs have one single color LED inside combined with a phosphor that converts that single color to white LEDs are used in many places They are the colored indicator lights on many electronic devices they can be used to make bright advertising signs brake lights on a car in TVs and more recently light bulbs for the home White LEDs bright enough to illuminate rooms are usually more expensive than regular lightbulb s but they last longer and burn less electricity LEDs which make their own light should not be confused with liquid crystal display LCDs which block light Todays LEDs can also base on surface mount technology and may be very small
