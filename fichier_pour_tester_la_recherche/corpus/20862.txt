 Bach Werke Verzeichnis is a list of all the pieces of music by Johann Sebastian Bach that are known In English language English it means Bach Works Catalogue The catalogue was made by Wolfgang Schmieder in He took all the music that is known by Johann Sebastian Bach and gave each piece a number Each piece of music by Bach therefore has a BWV number For example the Mass in B minor is BWV Giving each piece a number helps us to know exactly which piece of music we are talking about For example there are several Preludes and Fugues in G major but putting Prelude and Fugue in G major BWV makes it clear which one it is The BWV numbers are not listed chronology chronologically They are grouped according to what kind of music it is all the cantata s together all the concerto s together etc Some pieces of music may be written by Bach but we are not sure Those doubtful pieces of music are listed separately as BWV Anhang Some of what Schmieder wrote in has been updated because some new music by Bach has been discovered Other pieces of music have now been proved not to be by Bach Bach like many composers from long ago did not use opus numbers because very few of his works were published during his lifetime Some older books write S instead of BWV but Schmieder did not want this He wanted Bach s name to be used not his own
