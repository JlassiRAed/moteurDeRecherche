A formation or Rock rock formation is the fundamental unit of litho stratigraphy A formation consists of a certain number of rock stratum strata They have similar lithology or other properties Formations are not defined on the thickness of the rock strata and the thickness of different formations can therefore vary widely The concept of formally defined layers or strata is central to stratigraphy A formation can be divided into members and are themselves packed together in groups Formations were initially described as time markers based on relative ages and the law of superposition The divisions of the Earth history geologic time scale were the formations described and put in chronological order by the geologists and stratigraphers of the th and th centuries Rock formations are formed by sedimentary deposition in environment s which may persist for hundreds of millions of years For example the Hammersley Basin in Pilbara Western Australia is a Proterozoic sedimentary Basin basin where up to million years of sedimentation is preserved intact Here up to million years is represented by a single unit of banded iron formation and shale
