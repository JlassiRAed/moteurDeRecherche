 Special relativity Einstein knew that some weaknesses had been discovered in older physics For example older physics thought light moved in luminiferous aether Various tiny effects were expected if this theory were true Gradually it seemed these predictions were not going to work out Eventually Einstein drew the conclusion that the concepts of space and time needed a fundamental revision The result was special relativity theory This is based on the constancy of the speed of light in all inertial frames of reference and the principle of relativity inertial frame of reference a frame of reference that describes time and space homogeneously isotropically and in a time independent manner Shorthand space the same everywhere at all times principle of relativity the equations describing the laws of physics have the same form in all frames of reference Shorthand same equations work everywhere and at all times Galileo had already established the principle of relativity which said that physical events must look the same to all observers and no observer has the right way to look at the things studied by physics For example the Earth is moving very fast around the Sun but we do not notice it because we are moving with the Earth at the same speed therefore from our point of view the Earth is at rest However Galileo s math could not explain some things such as the speed of light According to him the measured speed of light should be different for different speeds of the observer in comparison with its source However the Michelson Morley experiment showed that this is not true at least not for all cases Einstein s theory of special relativity explained this among other things
