This templates rounds parameter to the number of digits after the point optionally given as parameter If parameter is negative rounding is to a multiple of If parameter is undefined numbers with digits before the point are rounded to integers numbers with digits before the point are rounded to digit after the point numbers with digits before the point are rounded to digits after the point and numbers with digit before the point or none are rounded to digits after the point In other words if parameter is undefined rounding is to significant digits except that it is not cruder than rounding to an integer and not finer than rounding to three digits after the decimal point Examples Note that trailing zeros are not shown so rounding can seem cruder than has actually been applied While this is a limitation of the template there is also the general problem that if a number is an integer with trailing zeros then the precision is not clear
