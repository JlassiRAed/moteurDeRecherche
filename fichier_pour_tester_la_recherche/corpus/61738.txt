An embedded system is a computer that has been built to solve only a few very specific problems and is not easily changed In contrast a general purpose computer can do many different jobs and can be changed at any time with new programs for new jobs An embedded system usually does not look like a computer often there is no keyboard or monitor or mouse But like any computer it has a microprocessor processor and software input and output The word embedded means it is built into the system It is a permanent part in a bigger system For example the controller embedded in an elevator tells the motor to move the elevator to different floors based on buttons that are pushed A decoder is embedded in a satellite television set top box to read a signal from the dish and send something that a TV understands Often this type of system must do its work in a specific amount of time This is called real time computing If a set top box got interrupted to do another task you would see a bad picture on the TV for example A general purpose computer will often have short pauses while it does something else it is not real time Embedded systems control many of the common devices in use today from card readers in hotel door locks to many controls in a car They can be small like an MP player or a digital camera to large systems like traffic light s airplane controls or assembly line controllers in a factory
