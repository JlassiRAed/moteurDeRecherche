In mathematics a finite set is a set that is not infinity infinite A finite set has a certain number of elements The elements of the set can be numbered like n and n must either be a natural number or zero An infinite set is a set with an unlimited number of elements Another definition is to say a set is finite if its cardinality is a natural number A set with n elements is called an n set n set A definition that is harder to understand but which is often used by mathematicians is to say that a set is finite if there is no strict subset that can be put in to correspondence with the set itself This means that the set of natural numbers is infinite
