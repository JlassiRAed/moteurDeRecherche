 Hydrogen iodide is a chemical compound Its chemical formula is HI It is a colorless odorous gas It reacts with oxygen to make iodine and water It can be made by reduction reducing iodine with hydrazine It can also be made by reacting iodide s with non oxidizing agent oxidizing acids such as phosphoric acid It can also be made by reacting hydrogen sulfide with iodine Very pure hydrogen iodide can be made by combining hydrogen and iodine but this is very slow It will break down if exposed to air It can be used to make illegal drugs and various chemical compounds of iodine It dissolves in water to produce hydroiodic acid Hydroiodic acid is a strong acid that is used to make iodide s
