An inductor is an electrical device used in electrical circuit s because of magnet ic charge An inductor is usually made from a coil of Electrical conductor conducting material like copper wire that is then wrapped around a magnetic core core made from either air or a magnetic metal If you use a more magnetic material as the core you can get the magnetic field around the inductor to be pushed in towards the inductor giving it better inductance Small inductors can also be put onto integrated circuit s using the same ways that are used to make transistor s Aluminum is usually used as the conducting material in this case
