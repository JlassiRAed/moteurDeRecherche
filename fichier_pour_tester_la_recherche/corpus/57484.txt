 Seymouria was an amphibian tetrapod from the early Permian of North America and Europe about to million years ago long As an adult animal Seymouria was well adapted to life on land with many reptile reptilian features It was for quite a long time thought to be a primitive reptile However it is now known that its early life stages were in water Apparently it is an amphibian whose adult stage was adapted for life in a dry climate The discovery of its amphibian nature was a considerable surprise the discovery of larval stages demonstrated conclusively that the seymouriamorphs were not biologically amniote s It has been shown conclusively that seymouriamorphs had an amphibian type life history with aquatic young stages that lost their external gills after metamorphosis Seymouriamorphs were definitely not amniotes themselves This means they were not reptiles The adult skeletons were first found in the red beds of Texas and Oklahoma These beds were laid down in the huge delta complex of a large river flowing towards a coast much like the Mississippi of today A simplified life cycle might be eggs laid in water larval stages in water young animal with limbs climbs out and instinctively moves to higher ground All its life lived as a carnivore on dry land returning to water occasionally to drink and to breed The adults would be able to operate in a fairly dry climate
