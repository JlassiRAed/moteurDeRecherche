The pollen tube is the tube through which sperm from the pollen reaches the egg cell and Fertilisation fertilises the plant to form seed s The pollen tube of most seed plants acts as a passageway It transports sperm cells from the pollen grain from the stigma to the ovule s at the base of the pistil Like fern s other basal land plants and many algae some gymnosperm s have flagellate sperm which swim through a watery fluid to fertilize the egg cells In angiosperms the pollen tube germinates from the pollen grain and grows the entire length through the stigma style ovary and ovules to reach the Ovum eggs In maize this single cell can grow longer than inches to traverse the length of the pistil The sperm cells by themselves are not motile and are carried within the tube As the tip of the tube reaches an egg it bursts and releases two sperm cells leading to a double fertilization One sperm unites with the egg cell to produce the embryo of a new plant while a second sperm unites with the central cell
