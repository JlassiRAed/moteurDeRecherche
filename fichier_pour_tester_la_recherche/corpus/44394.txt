A GV star or yellow dwarf is a main sequence star It is of Stellar classification spectral type G and luminosity class V on the Hertzsprung Russell Diagram The term yellow dwarf is a wikt misnomer misnomer because G type stars actually range in color from white for more luminous types like the Sun to only very slightly yellow for the less massive and luminous G type main sequence stars See Stellar classification Harvard spectral classification spectral classification for a chart of star color by light type GV stars are small and have a surface temperature of between and Kelvin K Our Sun is the most commonly known example of a GV star Each second it combines around million ton s of hydrogen to helium changing about million tons of matter to energy Our own Sun looks yellow through the Earth s atmosphere due to Rayleigh scattering Without that it would look white Even though the name dwarf is used to compare yellow main sequence stars from giant stars yellow dwarfs like the Sun are brighter than all of the stars in the Milky Way A GV star fuses hydrogen nuclei together and release energy for around billion years After the hydrogen is used up the star will grow to many times its earlier size and become a red giant like Aldebaran
