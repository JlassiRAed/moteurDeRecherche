In chemistry an ionic compound is a Chemical compound compound made of ion s They have strong ionic bond s between particles Lots of energy is required to break the bond apart resulting in high melting and boiling points The ions join together because they have different charge s compounds of metals and non metals are usually ionic They are made when two or more atoms come close together and an electron goes from one atom to the other atom The electron does this because both atoms want a full outer electron shell shell similar to those of the noble gases Note carbon and silicon in Group usually form covalent bonds by sharing electrons Note the elements in Group do not react with other elements to form ions
