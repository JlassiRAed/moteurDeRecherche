The cytoplasm is the protoplasm of a cell outside the cell nucleus It is the gel like material plus the organelle s outside the nucleus and inside the cell membrane Many important functions of a cell take place in organelles which are like bits of machinery for doing jobs The cytoplasm is highly structured it is not some kind of soup even though it is made out of water The cytosol contains a complex mixture of cytoskeleton filaments including the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus It includes dissolved molecules and water that fills much of the cell Due to this network of fibres membranes and the many dissolved macromolecule s such as protein s the cytosol does not act like a simple liquid biology stub
