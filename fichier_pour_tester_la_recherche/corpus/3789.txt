 Structural loads or actions are force s Deformation deformations and wikt displacement displacement s in structures Structural analysis is the wikt calculation calculation of the effects of loads on physical structures Excess load or overloading may cause structural failure This is a wikt consideration consideration in the design and construction of a structure Mechanical structures such as aircraft satellite s rocket s space station s ship s and submarine s have their own particular structural loads and actions Gravity on Earth is an attractive force that affects all objects A gravity load is one that the downward force of gravity affects
