 Baryons are composite subatomic particle s made of three quarks The most familiar baryons are the protons and neutrons which make up most of the visible matter in the universe Electrons are lepton s Since all quarks have a Spin resonances The lowest energy state of a baryon is a simple spin All particles with spin are called fermion s and obey Fermi Dirac statistics This means that no two fermions can be in the same point in space at the same time This is not true for the other type of subatomic particle called a boson More than one boson like a photon can exist in the same point in space at the same time Baryons are part of a larger collection of subatomic compounds called hadron s Hadrons are simply particles made of quarks The other type of hadron is called a meson The name baryon comes from Greek barys meaning heavy
