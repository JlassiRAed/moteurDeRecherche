The Baby boom galaxy is a starburst galaxy billion light years away It was discovered by NASA s Spitzer Science Center at the California Institute of Technology The galaxy is the new record holder for the List of galaxies Brightness and power brightest starburst galaxy in the very distant universe its brightness being a measure of its extreme Star formation star formation rate The Baby boom galaxy has been called the extreme stellar machine because it is seen producing star s at a surprising rate of up to per year Our Milky Way galaxy turns out an average of just stars per year At its rate the galaxy needs only million years to grow into an equivalent of the most massive galaxy ever observed The discovery challenges the accepted model for Galaxy formation and evolution galaxy formation This has most galaxies slowly bulking up by absorbing pieces of other galaxies rather than growing internally This galaxy is undergoing a major baby boom producing most of its stars all at once said Peter Capak of NASA s Spitzer Science Center To that the principal investigator of the Cosmic Evolution Survey or Nick Scoville of Caltech responded We may be witnessing for the first time the formation of one of the most massive elliptical galaxies in the universe
