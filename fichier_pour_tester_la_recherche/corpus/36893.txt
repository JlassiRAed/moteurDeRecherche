 GRB was a gamma ray burst afterglow It was seen on February Since scientists had predicted GRBs to be followed by afterglows But until this event GRBs had only been seen in very luminosity bright bursts of high energy gamma ray s The burst had several peaks in its light curve It lasted around seconds The light curve was not normal This suggested that a supernova may have happened as well GRB happened in the same place as a galaxy about billion light year s away This means that GRBs happen outside the Milky Way
