 Sex linkage is a term in genetics It applies to allele s on the X chromosome In mammal s which have an XX XY system of sex determination the X chromosome has many more genes than the Y chromosome This explains the Heredity inheritance of such conditions as colour blindness and haemophilia They are caused by recessive alleles and usually do not show the condition in females This is because those females carrying the mutant are most likely to be heterozygous for the allele However if the Mutation mutant allele is carried by a male the condition will develop because his X chromosome has the mutant allele but his Y chromosome has no allele at that locus
