 Atmospheric circulation is a large scale movement of masses of air The origin of these processes is the sun s radiation The sun waves radiate the short wave radiation The earth absorbs only a part of this energy The other part is radiated back to the atmosphere and to the universe The back radiation is long waved The thermal energy is distributed thanks to the circulation of the air on the surface of the earth The demonstration of circulation varies from year to year but the basic Climatology climatologic structure is almost constant We recognize cells the Hadley cell the Ferrel cell and the Polar cell The movement of air masses is influenced by Coriolis effect coriolis force It means that the air diverts to the west
