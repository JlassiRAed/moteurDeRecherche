In geodesy a meridian arc is the distance between two points with the same longitude In geometry it is an arc a segment of a curve The length of an imagination imaginary rope laid over the globe would be that distance Two or more such measurements at different places get the shape of the reference ellipsoid which is most like the shape of the geoid This process is called the determination of the figure of the Earth The earliest determinations of the size of a spherical Earth used a single arc The latest determinations use astro geodetic measurements and the methods of satellite geodesy to get the reference ellipsoids The Alexandria n scientist Eratosthenes about BC first calculated a good value for circumference of the Earth He knew that on the summer solstice at local noon the sun goes through the zenith in the ancient Egypt ian city of Syene Assuming that Alexandria was due north of Syene Eratosthenes concluded that the distance between Alexandria and Syene must be of Earth s circumference In Newton published in the Principia a proof that the Earth was an oblate spheroid of flattening equal to
