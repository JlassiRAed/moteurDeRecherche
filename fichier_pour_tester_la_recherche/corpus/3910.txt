 Ca Al rich inclusions are centimeter sized light coloured calcium and aluminium rich inclusions found in carbonaceous chondrite s CAIs contains high temperature minerals and are among the first solids which solidified from the cooling protoplanetary disk CAIs were formed at much higher temperatures than the associated chondrule s and may have survived many high temperature events whereas most chondrules are the product of a single wikt transient transient melting event The isotope isotopic wikt anomaly anomalies of CAIs give valuable clues about the solar system s formation suggesting that the solar nebula collapsed shortly after a nearby supernova Radiometric dating shows that the CAIs formed about million years before the chondrules formed
