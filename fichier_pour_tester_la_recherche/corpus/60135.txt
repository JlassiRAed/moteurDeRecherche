 Infinity is about things which never end Sometimes it is also written Infinity means many different things depending on when it is used The word is from a Latin word which means without end Infinity goes on forever so sometimes space numbers and other things are said to be infinite because they never come to a stop Infinity is not really an ordinary number but it is sometimes used as one Infinity often says how many there is of something instead of how big something is For example there are infinitely many whole number s but there is no integer which is infinitely big But different kinds of math have different kinds of infinity So its meaning often changes There are two kinds of infinity potential infinity and wikt actual actual infinity Potential infinity is a process that never stops For example adding to a number No matter how many times is added more can still be added Actual infinity is a more abstract idea For example there are infinitely many numbers as it is impossible to write them all down
