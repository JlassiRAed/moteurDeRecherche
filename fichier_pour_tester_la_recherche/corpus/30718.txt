 Vibration isolation is a system of devices to decouple a mechanical or structural object from its vibrating supports For example the handles of the saw presented in the right photo are separated from the engine and cutting bar to reduce shaking for the operator Here the spring mount is a part of this vibration isolation system When the targeted object is rather heavy vibration isolation may be called base isolation Vibration isolation is a branch of protective techniques known as vibration control
