 Amphibians are members of the class and caecilian s They are tetrapod four legged vertebrate s which are Ectotherm cold blooded Amphibians lay their eggs in water usually in a foam nest After wikt hatch hatching they are tadpole s which live in the water and have gill s The tadpoles change into adults in a process called metamorphosis When they are adult they have lung s to breathe instead of gills and legs Adult amphibians also use their skin to take in oxygen and some species of salamanders do not have lungs The earliest amphibians evolution evolved in the Devonian from sarcopterygii lobe finned fish which had jointed leg like fins with digits They could crawl along the sea bottom Some had developed primitive lungs to help them breathe air when the stagnant pools of the Devonian swamp s were low in oxygen They could also use their strong fins to hoist themselves out of the water and onto dry land if necessary For quite a while during the Carboniferous and early Permian amphibia were top predators on land especially in the low lying tropical river systems In the drier conditions which followed they were less effective and the ancestors of mammals and reptiles gradually took over the land They laid cleidoic egg s which had hard shells and could be laid out of water Most of the large early amphibians went extinct in the Triassic period a few survived to the Lower Cretaceous The only living amphibiana today are the Lissamphibia These include the Anura Amphibia are found everywhere in the world except Antarctica and there are about different species of them are in the Anura Conservation is therefore an important concern
