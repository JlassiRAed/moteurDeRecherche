In mathematics and computer science the term Canonical form or sometimes Normal form refers to the usual representation of a mathematical object For example the canonical form of a positive integer in decimal representation is a finite set finite sequence of digit s that does not begin with zero Mathematics has defined equivalence relation s for some objects These equivalence relations say that certain classes of objects are equal These objects then belong to the same equivalence class In such a case a canonical form consists in the choice of a specific object in each class For example row echelon form and Jordan normal form are canonical forms for matrix matrices
