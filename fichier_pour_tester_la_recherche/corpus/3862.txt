In organic chemistry an electrocyclic reaction is a type of pericyclic reaction pericyclic rearrangement reaction The reaction is electrocyclic if the result is one pi bond becoming one sigma bond or one sigma bond becoming a pi bond Electrocyclic reactions share the following property properties The torquoselectivity in an electrocyclic reaction refers to the direction that the substituent s rotation rotate For example the substituents in a reaction that is conrotatory can still rotate in two directions It produces a mixture of two products that are the mirror image of each other Chemist s are interested in electrocyclic reactions because the geometry of the molecule s confirm a number of predictions made by theoretical chemistry theoretical chemists They confirm the conservation of molecular orbital symmetry The Nazarov cyclization reaction is an electrocyclic reaction that closes a ring It converts divinylketone s to cyclopentenone s An example is the thermal ring opening reaction of dimethylcyclobutene The cis isomer only Yield yields cis trans hexadiene But the trans isomer gives the trans trans diene The frontier orbital method explains how this reaction works The sigma bond in the reactant will open in a way that the resulting p orbital s will have the same symmetry as the highest occupied molecular orbital The following diagram shows this The stereospecificity of the result depends on whether the reaction proceeds through a conrotatory or disrotatory process
