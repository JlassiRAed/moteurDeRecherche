 Exponentiation is an arithmetic operation on number s It is repeated multiplication just as multiplication is repeated addition People write exponentiation with upper index This looks like this The number is the base and is the exponent To calculate The equation could be read out loud in this way raised to the power of equals Examples If the exponent is equal to then the power is called square because the area of a square square is calculated using So If the exponent is equal to then the power is called cube because the volume of a cube is calculated using So If the exponent is equal to then the person must calculate the inverse of the base So If the exponent is an integer and is less than then the person must invert the number and calculate the power For example If the exponent is equal to Example Similarly if the exponent is the result is the nth root so If the exponent is a rational number then the result is the q th root of the base raised to the power of p so The exponent may not even be rational To raise a base a to an irrational x th power we use an infinity infinite sequence of rational number s limit is x like this There are some rules which help to calculate powers It is possible to calculate exponentiation of matrix matrices The matrix must be square For example
