 Stability is a property of many system s It means being at rest not liable to change In mechanics and fluid dynamics dynamics a system is stable if it will not change motion of its own accord and will resist small efforts to change its direction or position Thus an airliner in flight is dynamically stable and will keep going in the same direction even when buffeted by uneven air pressure To change its direction its control system must be altered On the other hand a fighter plane is unstable and must be controlled at all times by a combination of the pilot and a computer Most nuclear isotope s are unstable but the world is mostly made of stable ones
