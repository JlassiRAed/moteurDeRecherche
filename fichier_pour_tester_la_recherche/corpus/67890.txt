 Linear regression is a special case of regression analysis which tries to explain the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more explanatory variable s function Mathematical functions are used to predict or estimate the value of the dependent variables In linear regression these functions are linear predictor function linear Linear regression was the first type of regression analysis to be studied rigorously This is because models which depend linearly on their unknown parameter parameters are easier to curve fitting fit than models which are non linearly related to their parameters What is more the statistical properties of the resulting estimators are easier to determine Linear regression has many practical uses Most applications fall into one of the following two broad categories Linear regression models are often fitted using the least squares approach Other ways of fitting exist they include minimizing the lack of fit in some other norm or minimizing a penalized version of the least squares loss function as in ridge regression The least squares approach can also be used to fit models that are not linear As ountlined above the terms least squares and linear model are closely linked but they are not synonyms
