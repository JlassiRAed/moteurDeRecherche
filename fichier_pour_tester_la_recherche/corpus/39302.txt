A wormhole is a Theory theoretical connection between a black hole and a white hole creating a shortcut through time and Space space It is not known if wormholes exist in nature Scientists believe that if wormholes existed they could not be made following any traditional scientific methods In order to hold a wormhole open a form of theoretical exotic matter would be needed Otherwise the wormhole would simply disappear very quickly after its creation If plotted on a dimensional plane the wormhole bends the plane like folding a paper so that the two ends would be touching The term wormhole was first used by John Wheeler a theoretical physicist It is also known as EINSTEIN ROSEN BRIDGE A Worm hole is much like a tunnel with two ends each in separate points in SPACE TIME Researchers have no observational evidence for worm holes
