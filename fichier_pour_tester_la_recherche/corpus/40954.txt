A cloud is water vapour in the atmosphere that has condensed into very small water droplets or ice crystals that appear in visible shapes or formations above the ground Water on the Earth evaporation evaporates and rises up into the sky Higher up where the air is colder the water condense s it changes from a gas to drops of water or crystals of ice We see these drops of water as clouds The drops fall back down to earth as rain and then the water evaporates again This is called the water cycle The atmosphere always has some water vapour Clouds form when the atmosphere can no longer hold all the invisible air vapor Warm air holds more water vapor than cool air So if warm air with lots of water inside cools it can form a cloud These are ways air can cool enough to form clouds Clouds are heavy The water in a cloud can have a mass of several million tons Every cubic metre of the cloud has only about grams of water in it Cloud droplets are also about times heavier than evaporated water so they are much heavier than air They do not fall but stay in the air because there is warm air all round the heavier water droplets When water changes from gas to droplets this makes heat Because the droplets are very small they stick to the warm air Sometimes clouds appear to be brilliant colors at sunrise or sunset This is due to dust particles in the air
