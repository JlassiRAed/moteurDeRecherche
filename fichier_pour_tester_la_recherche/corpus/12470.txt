Superfluidity is a very special state of matter where a liquid can act very strangely Some of the things a superfluid can do is It can flow extremely easily In fact it flows so easily that friction does not change the way it flows it has zero viscosity Because of this it can actually flow out of a container like a bowl even when the bowl is not tipped so the liquid can spill out It stays still when its container is spun instead of starting a whirlpool like when a sink full of water is drained However a whirlpool does form if the container is spun at and above a certain speed So far scientists have only been able to create superfluids at extremely cold temperatures However superfluids have quite a few uses in science today like Superfluid Helium at degrees Celsius degrees Fahrenheit was used in a special satellite in to get information on infrared waves in space Superfluids can be used in gyroscopes to help machines predict information about gravity movements that can t be picked up with regular instruments only One kind of superfluid was used to trap and slow down a beam of light from Speed of lightThere is also another state of matter called a supersolid although how they are formed is more complex
