A blast furnace is a special type of furnace for smelting iron from ore Blast furnaces are very large They can be up to in diameter The blast furnace is the biggest chemical reactor Blast furnaces are also called high ovens A blast furnace is usually built with a steel case and brick s made of wikt magnesia magnesia inside the case Magnesia is very wikt resistance resistant to heat It does not melt The furnace is cooled with water running inside part of the case and bricks The process of making iron is simple Iron ore is basically iron oxide Iron is made by removing the oxygen This leaves crude iron called pig iron This process of removing oxygen is called smelting Carbon is used in the reduction reduction process with the ore heated to a high temperature Carbon easily takes the oxygen off the ore in high temperature s
