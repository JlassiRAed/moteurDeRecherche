 The Tenerife airport disaster happened on March when two Boeing Boeing s collided on the ground of Los Rodeos Airport This crash killed people onboard the two flights The crash was caused by many reasons One reason is that as the KLM captain wanted to takeoff quickly so that he could return to Amsterdam This made him misunderstand that he was cleared by Air Traffic Controller to takeoff and so he began to take off eventually crashing into the Pan Am flight Another reason was the fog surrounding the airport The bad weather reduced the visibility meaning the pilots could not see each other and neither could the controllers see the two planes on the runway Because of the fog the pilots only saw each other at the last minute when they could not have prevented the crash If there was no fog the KLM crew would have seen the Pan Am plane on the runway and would not have taken off It was the worst crash in the history of aviation
