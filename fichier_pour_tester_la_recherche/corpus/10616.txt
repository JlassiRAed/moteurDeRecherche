 Venus of Willendorf also known as the Woman of Willendorf is an cm high statue tte of a female figure It was discovered in by archaeologist Josef Szombathy at a paleolithic site near Willendorf Willendorf is a village in Lower Austria near the city of Krems The statuette is made of a kind of limestone that can not be found in the area It is colored with red ochre A study made in suggests that the figure was made between and BCE Very little is known about its origin how it was made or what it meant to the people who made it The Venus is not a realistic portrait but rather an idealization of the female figure Her vulva breast s and swollen belly are very pronounced This suggests a strong connection to fertility Her tiny arms are folded over her breasts and she has no visible face Her head is covered with what might be coils of braid s eyes or a kind of headdress The lack of a face has prompted some archaeologists and philosophers to view the Venus as a universal mother The nickname urging a comparison of this rather obesity obese figurine to the classical image of Venus causes resistance in some modern analysis The ironic identification of these figurines as Venus pleasantly satisfied certain assumptions at the time about the primitive about women and about taste Christopher Witcombe has noticed At the same time there is professional reluctance to identify her as an Earth Mother goddess of paleolithic Old European culture Old Europe The statue s feet do not allow it to stand on its own Due to this it has been speculated that it was meant to be held rather than simply looked at Catherine McCoid and LeRoy McDermott think that the figurines were done as self portraits by the women themselves Most scientists agree that the head seen from a profile view while having no distinct facial features appears to be looking down The common physical characteristics of all of the Venus figures are a thin upper torso largely exaggerated breasts large buttocks and thighs a large stomach and oddly bent short legs that end with disproportionately small feet Yet when looked upon as if you were a woman looking down at your body the physical features in perspective seem correct There are striking similarities between the Venus of Willendorf and a pregnant woman when perceived from above Venus of Willendorf is part of the collection of the Naturhistorisches Museum in Vienna Since this figure s discovery and naming several similar statuettes and other forms of art have been discovered They are collectively referred to as Venus figurines
