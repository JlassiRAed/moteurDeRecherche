 Flash memory is a memory storage device for computers and electronics It is most often used in devices like digital cameras USB flash drive s and video games It is quite similar to EEPROM Flash memory is different from Random access memory RAM because RAM is volatile storage but it is bulky and fragile Flash memory is one kind of Non volatile random access memory It is slower than RAM but faster than hard drives It is much used in small electronics because it is small and has no moving parts The main weakness of flash memory is that it is more expensive than hard drives for the same amount of storage Another weakness of flash memory is the number of times that data can be written to it Data can be read from flash as many times as desired but after a certain number of write operations it will stop working Most flash devices are designed for about write operations EEPROM has the same limitation that flash does it can only survive about write cycles But it is more expensive than flash so it is rarely used for storage greater than kB The main difference between EEPROM and flash memory is that EEPROM can write to any byte of memory at any time Flash memory can only write to an entire chunk or sector of memory at a time That means that if the user wants to change only one byte flash must also re write all the bytes in that sector This means that flash memory can wear out faster than EEPROM Flash Memory can store as many as hundreds of GBs Many are in the form of a pen drive Flash memory is used in USB Drives SSD Drives computer RAM graphics cards and memory card s
