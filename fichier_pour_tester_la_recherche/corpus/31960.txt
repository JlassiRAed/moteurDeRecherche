 Xpress is a steel roller coaster launched roller coaster at Walibi Holland in The Netherlands It opened in under the name Superman the Ride However Six Flags was planning to open it under the name Riddlers Revenge and the ride was painted green at the factory Shortly before the coaster was built the name was changed to Superman the Ride and was painted red and blue Since the coaster is called Xpress It is the first LSM coaster in Europe The coaster had been standing but not operating for the whole season in The reason for this was because important parts of the launch mechanism were broken which can cause that the train does not have enough speed at the end of the launch or doesn t launch at all These parts are ordered and are only made on request as there are only coasters of this type worldwide Therefore Walibi Holland decided to paint the track As of the coaster operates again
