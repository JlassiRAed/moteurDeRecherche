 Photodissociation photolysis or photodecomposition is a chemical reaction in which a chemical compound is broken down by photon s One or more photons interact with the target molecule Photodissociation is not limited to visible light Any photon with sufficient energy can affect the chemical bonds of a chemical compound Since a photon s energy is inversely proportional to its wavelength electromagnetic wave s with the energy of visible light or higher such as ultraviolet light x ray s and gamma ray s are usually involved in such reactions One example where this is used is the Light dependent reaction of photosynthesis
