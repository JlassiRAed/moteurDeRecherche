 Temperature is how hot or cold a thing is Our bodies can feel the difference between something which is hot and something which is cold To measurement measure temperature more accurate ly a thermometer can be used Thermometers use a temperature scale to record how hot or cold something is The scale most often used is in degrees Celsius to measure temperature because it never goes below zero science Scientifically temperature is a physical quantity which describes how quickly molecule s are moving inside a material In solid s and liquid s the molecules are vibrating around a fixed point in the substance but in gas es they are in free flight and bouncing off each other as they travel In a gas the temperature pressure and volume of the gas are closely related by a law of physics
