 Gene silencing is a general term describing epigenetic processes of gene regulation It is used to describe the switching off of a gene by a mechanism other than genetic engineering That is a gene which would be expressed under normal circumstances is switched off by machinery in the cell When a gene is silenced it means that its RNA is unable to make a protein Gene s are regulated at either the Transcription translation Transcriptional gene silencing is done by histone modifications which put heterochromatin around a gene This means the transcriptional machinery cannot get at the gene Genes may be silenced by DNA methylation This happens regularly during development when genes are turned on and off at different stages Post transcriptional gene silencing is done by blocking or destroying the Messenger RNA mRNA of a particular gene The destruction of the mRNA prevents translation to form an active gene product A common way mRNA gets silenced is by RNAi Both transcriptional and post transcriptional gene silencing are used to regulate genes Methods of gene silencing also protect the organism s genome from transposon s and virus es Gene silencing thus may be part of an ancient immune system protecting cells from such infectious DNA and RNA
