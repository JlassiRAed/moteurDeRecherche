In computer science a schema or database schema describes the structure of a database in a formal language that is supported by the database management system Using the database schema it is possible to create a blueprint of the database This blueprint will not contain any Information data The database schema uses logical formulas to create integrity constraints It is not possible to insert data into the database that violates these integrity constraints All contraints use the same language There are different kinds of database schemas The conceptual schema expresses the concepts in the database and how they relate to each other The logical schema is a mapping of entities with their attributes and the respective relations The physical schema is a particular implementation of a logical schema Ideally a database schema should have the following properties It should be complete all information in the source should be included It should be minimal it should not be possible to leave out a relation without losing information It should be database normalization normalized A certain piece of information should be in the schema only once
