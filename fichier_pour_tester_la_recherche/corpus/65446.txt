A mycorrhiza is a symbiosis symbiotic association between a fungus and the root s of a plant In a mycorrhiza the fungus lives inside the plant roots and in the earth The fungal hypha e are more efficiency efficient than plant roots at absorbing nutrient s Mycorrhizas are important for plant growth in many ecosystem s At least of all land plant species Ecophysiology of VA mycorrhizal plants CRC Press FloridaMycorrhizas are divided onto two main types ectomycorrhiza and endomycorrhiza The hyphae of ectomycorrhizal fungi do not penetrate individual cells within the root while the hyphae of endomycorrhizal fungi penetrate the cell wall and invaginate the cell membrane The mycorrhizal symbiosis is ancient dating to at least million years ago
