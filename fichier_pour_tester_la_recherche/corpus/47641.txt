In cryptanalysis a brute force attack is a method of breaking a Cryptography cryptographic system by trying a lot of possibilities using fast computer s for example a large number of the possible key key s in a key space to Encryption decrypt an encrypted message The theoretical possibility of a brute force attack is recognized by the Cryptography cryptographic system designers they work to make the Cryptography cryptographic system very improbable for computers to break using brute force attack For that reason one of the definitions of breaking a cryptographic scheme is to find a method faster than a brute force attack The selection of an appropriate Key size key length depends on how much it will be difficult to break it using a brute force attack By Obfuscation obfuscating the data before encryption brute force attacks are less effective and more difficult to determine The brute force attack can be used with a dictionary attack
