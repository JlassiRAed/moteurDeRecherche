A planetary nebula is a emission nebula nebula that is made up of gas and Plasma plasma They are made by certain types of star s when they die They are named this because they look like gas giant planets through small telescope optical telescopes They do not last for very long compared to a star only tens of thousands of years At the end of a average normal sized star s life in the red giant phase the outside layers of a star are disposed of Because the outside is gone the star shines brightly and is very hot The ultraviolet radiation given off by the center of the star ionization ionizes the gas and plasma that was thrown out from the star This is what causes a planetary nebula to look like it does Planetary nebulae are very special objects because they can help make more stars When a star dies the metals that were in the core of the star are sent to other places in the universe The only place that these metals form are in stars This is called nucleosynthesis The pictures of these nebulae show that they have very weird shapes Scientists are not sure why they are not all spheres There are many theory theories about why they are not They think that binary star s stellar wind s and magnetic field s might be part of the reason they look so special
