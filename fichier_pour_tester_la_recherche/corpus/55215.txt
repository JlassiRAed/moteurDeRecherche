The Chandrasekhar limit is the maximum mass of a stable white dwarf star The Chandrasekhar limit is the mass above which electron degeneracy pressure in the star s core is not enough to balance the star s own gravitational self attraction Then white dwarfs with masses over the limit would gravitationally collapse into a neutron star or black hole However white dwarfs usually explode before they undergo collapse Those with masses under the limit remain stable as white dwarfs
