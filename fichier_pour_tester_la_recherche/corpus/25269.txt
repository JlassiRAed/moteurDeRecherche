 Key exchange is any method in cryptography by which key cryptographic key s are exchanged between users allowing use of a Cryptosystem cryptographic system If two parties wish to exchange encrypted messages each needs to know how to decryption decrypt received messages and to encryption encrypt sent messages The information they require to do so depends on the encryption technique they might use If they use a Telegraph code both will require a copy of the same Morse code codebook If they use a cipher they will need appropriate keys If the cipher is a Symmetric key algorithm symmetric key cipher both will need a copy of the same key If an Public key cryptography asymmetric key cipher with the public private key property both will need the other s public key The key exchange problem is how to exchange whatever keys or other information needed so in such a way that no one else can obtain a copy Usually this required trusted secure channel With the arrival of could decryption decrypt the message In principle then the only remaining problem was to be sure that a Public key cryptography public key actually belonged to its claimed owner this is not a problem easy to solve specially when the two users involved have never met and know nothing about each other In Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman published a cryptography cryptographic protocol which allows users to establish secure channel s in order to exchange keys even if an attacker is monitoring that communication channel However Diffie Hellman key exchange did not address the identity authentication problem of being sure of the actual identity of the person or an entity Public key infrastructure s have been proposed go around the problem of identity authentication In their most usual implementation each user applies to a certificate authority for a Public key certificate digital certificate which serves for other users as a correct authentication of identity In contrast the web of trust system which do not use central certificate authority at all Each user is responsible for verifying any certificate from another user before using that certificate to communicate with the user who claims to be associated with the particular public key in a certificate The problem of key exchange has not yet been solved In particular it has not yet been solved for the modern situation of two previously unknown users attempting to communicate electronically as for instance in electronic commerce Some of the existing work around designs work more or less but are not fully satisfactory
