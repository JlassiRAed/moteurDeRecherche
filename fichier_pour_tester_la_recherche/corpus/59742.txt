 The Big Bang is a science scientific theory about how the universe started and then made the star s and galaxy galaxies we see today The universe began very heat hot size small and density dense with no stars atom s form or structure that an expanding universe could be traced back in time to an originating single point The universe is still expanding today but getting colder as well As a whole universe is growing and the temperature is falling as time passes Cosmology is the study of the universe began and its development Scientist s that study cosmology agree the Big Bang theory matches what they have observed so far Fred Hoyle called the theory the Big Bang on his radio show He did not believe the Big Bang was correct Scientists who did not agree with him thought the name was funny and decided to use it Since then Fred Hoyle s reasons for not agreeing with the theory have been proved wrong Scientists base the Big Bang theory on many different observation s The most important is the redshift of very far away galaxy galaxies Redshift is the Doppler effect occurring in light When an object moves away from Earth its color rays look more similar to the color red than they actually are because the movement stretches the wavelength of light given off by the object Scientists use the word red hot to describe this stretched light wave because red is the longest wavelength on the visible spectrum The more redshift there is the faster the object is moving away By measuring the redshift scientists proved that the universe is expanding and they can work out how fast the object is moving away from the Earth With very exact observation and measurements scientists believe that the universe was a singularity approximately billion years ago Because most things become cold er as they expand scientists assume that the universe was very small and very hot when it started Other observations that support the Big Bang theory are the amounts of chemical element s in the universe Amounts of very light elements such as hydrogen helium and lithium seem to agree with the theory of the Big Bang Scientists also have found cosmic microwaves wikt background background radiation This radiation is known as radio waves and they are everywhere in the universe This radiation is now very weak and cold but a long time ago it was very strong and very hot It could be said that time had no meaning before the Big Bang If the Big Bang was the beginning of time then there was no universe before the Big Bang since there could not be any before if there was no time Other ideas state that the Big Bang was not the beginning of time billion years ago Instead some believe that there was a completely different universe before the Big Bang and it may have been very different from the one we know today
