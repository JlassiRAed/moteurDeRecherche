In cryptography a stream cipher is a Symmetric key algorithm symmetric key cipher where plaintext bits are combined with a pseudorandom cipher bit stream operation In a stream cipher the Plaintext Numerical digit digits are encrypted one at a time and the transformation of successive digits varies during the encryption state An alternative name is a state cipher as the encryption of each digit is dependent on the current state In practice the digits are typically single bit s or byte s Stream ciphers represent a different approach to Symmetric key algorithm symmetric encryption from block cipher s Block ciphers operate on large blocks of fixed length Stream ciphers typically execute at a higher speed than block ciphers and have lower hardware requirements However stream ciphers can be susceptible to serious security problems if used incorrectly for example in particular the same starting state must never be used twice A stream cipher makes use of a much smaller and more convenient Key cryptographic key for example Key size
