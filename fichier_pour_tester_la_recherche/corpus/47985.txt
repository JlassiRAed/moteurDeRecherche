The amount of incoming solar radiation also called insolation determines the temperature on Earth This temperature rises and falls according to the strength of radiation given off by the sun the distance from the earth to the sun and the tilt of the Earth s axis of rotation However the recent change between glacial and inter glacial states that occurs on a circa year timescale does not correlate well with these factors This is known as the year problem Due to milankovich cycle variations in the Earth s orbit the amount of insolation varies there are periods of around and years Variations in the amount of solar energy drive changes in the climate of the Earth and are recognised as a key factor in the timing of start and termination of glaciation s Looking at strata isotope analysis can be performed One of the most precise methods consist in using Oxygen The amount of oxygen mainly depends on the amount of ice that can be found and on the temperature of the planet There are different hypothesis hypotheses to explain the phenomenon
