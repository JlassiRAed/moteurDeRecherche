 Lamellibrachia is a genus genus of cold seep tube worms These are related to giant tube worm s They live on the floor of the ocean s near cold seep s There crude oil and methane leak out of the ocean floor The worm forms a symbiosis with certain bacteria which can oxidation oxidise sulphide s The worm provides the bacteria with hydrogen sulphide and oxygen It does this by taking them up from the environment and binding them to a haemoglobin molecule In return the bacteria feed the worm The worms can grow to a length of about metres Together they form a biogenic habitat by creating groups of hundreds or thousands of individuals Living in these aggregations are over a hundred different species of organism many of which are found only at these seeps Cold seeps and hydrothermal vent s are the only known communities that do not rely on photosynthesis for food and energy production Unlike hydrothermal vents which are short lived environments cold seeps leak oil and gas slowly Probably because of the cooler temperatures and stability many cold seep organisms are much longer lived than those inhabiting hydrothermal vents These worm grow very slowly but can reach lengths of over feet This means individuals may live over years Science Daily
