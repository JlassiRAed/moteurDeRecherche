 An atom is the basic unit that makes up all matter There are many different types of atoms each with its own name mass and size These different atoms are called chemical element s The chemical elements are organized on the periodic table Examples of elements are hydrogen and gold Atoms are very small but the exact size changes depending on the element Atoms range from to nanometer s in width This makes atoms impossible to see without special tools Equation s must be used to see the way they work and how they interact with other atoms Atoms join together to make molecule s for example two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom combine to make a water molecule When atoms join together it is called a chemical reaction Every atom is made up of three kinds of smaller particles called proton s The protons and neutrons are heavier and stay in the middle of the atom They are called the atomic nucleus nucleus They are surrounded by a cloud of electrons which are very light in weight and are attracted to the positive charge of the nucleus This attraction is called electromagnetic force Protons and neutrons are made up of even smaller particles called quark s Electrons are elementary particle elementary or fundamental particles they cannot be split into smaller parts The number of protons neutrons and electrons an atom has tells us what element it is Hydrogen for example has one proton no neutrons and one electron the element sulfur has protons neutrons and electrons Atoms move faster when they are in gas form as atoms in liquids do
