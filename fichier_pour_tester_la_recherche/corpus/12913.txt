 Computer engineering is the practice of making computer s and their parts Computer engineers are always trying to make new parts smaller and better They can also work on software especially software for embedded system s Computers are electrical machines that run programs So Computer engineering has parts of both electrical engineering and computer science software engineering In Computer engineering classes students learn about the hardware and software of computers This starts with learning how transistor s and computer chip s are made and how they work This is the electrical part They also learn how to program the Read only memory ROM or Flash memory so the computer can do something useful Because Computer engineering is closely related to electrical engineering and computer science the fields are found in the same department at many universities Students also need to learn fundamental science subjects and mathematics such as calculus and differential equation s Computer engineering is difficult to learn but computer engineers are needed Software engineering companies telecommunications firms designers of digital hardware and many other companies hire computer engineering majors right out of college and pay them well
