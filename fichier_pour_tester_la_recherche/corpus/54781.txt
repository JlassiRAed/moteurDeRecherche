The square metre square whose sides measure exactly one metre The square metre is derived from the SI base unit of the metre which in turn is defined as the length of the path travelled by light in absolute vacuum during a time interval of of a second Adding SI prefix es creates multiples and submultiples however as the unit is squared the order of magnitude difference between units doubles from their comparable linear units For example a kilometre is one thousand times the length of a metre but a square kilometre is one million times the area of a square metre A square metre is not the same as a metre square an area metres wide by metres long would be square metres In contrast a metre square is actually square metres
