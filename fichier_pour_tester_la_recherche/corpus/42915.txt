A prion is an infectious protein The word is short for proteinaceous infectious particles All known prion diseases in mammals affect the structure of the brain or other neuron neural tissue At present they are untreatable and always fatal Prions cause many forms of encephalitis or brain disease such as prion disease scrapie Creutzfeldt Jakob Disease kuru Prions work by changing the shape of proteins in the infected animals While normal proteins have lots of alpha helix alpha helices or twisted parts changed proteins have lots of beta sheet s or flat parts The word is pronounced pree on Because prions are proteins and proteins cannot reproduce themselves it is a mystery how prions work A vast amount of molecular biology research is going on to find out how they reproduce themselves with no clear result at present
