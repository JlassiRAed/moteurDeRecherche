In cryptography the Advanced Encryption Standard on November after a year standardization process in which fifteen competing designs were presented and evaluated before Rijndael was selected as the most suitable It became effective as a standard May As of AES is one of the most popular algorithm s used in Symmetric key algorithm symmetric key cryptography It is available by choice in many different encryption packages This marks the first time that the public has had access to a cipher algorithm approved by National Security Agency NSA for Classified information top secret information This cipher algorithm was developed by two Belgium Belgian cryptographers Joan Daemen and Vincent Rijmen and submitted to the AES selection process under the name Rijndael a Portmanteau word portmanteau of the names of the inventors Rijndael is Strictly speaking AES is not precisely Rijndael following are the main differences Rijndael supports a larger range of block size block sizes and key size s and can use any combination of key and block sizes in any multiple of bits with a minimum of bits and a maximum of bits AES has a fixed block size block sizes of bit s and three values of key size or bits Many AES public products use Key size bit secret keys by default it is possible that the National Security Agency NSA may assume that bit secret keys are weak and they may prefer Key size longer keys for top secret documents Unlike DES AES is a substitution permutation network not a Feistel cipher Feistel network AES is fast in both computer software software and hardware is relatively easy to implement and requires little computer memory memory As a new encryption standard it is currently being deployed on a large scale on various platforms
