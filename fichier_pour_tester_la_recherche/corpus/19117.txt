A semimetal or a metalloid is a chemical element Metalloids are elements that have the propeties of both metal and non metal elements It might be shiny but brittle It might be dull but conducts electricity The most common semimetal is silicon Silicon has electrical wikt conductivity conductivity between metals and nonmetals It is a semiconductor An approximate way to classify metalloids is to look at the Periodic Table of elements See the double diagonal line top left Boron and Aluminium bottom right Polonium and Astatine Those diagonals are the metalloids Some metalloids are not semimetals and some semimetals are not metalloids
