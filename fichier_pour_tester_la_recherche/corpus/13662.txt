 Abstract algebra is a part of mathematics math which studies algebraic structure s These include It is normal to build a theory on one kind of structure like group theory or category theory The purpose of the theory of each concept is to organize the precise definition of the concept examples of it its substructures the ways to relate different examples of the concept algebraically and the concept s applications both inside its own theory and outside in other areas of mathematics During history different fields of mathematics have used algebra s Algebras are about finding or specifying rules on how to calculate with certain mathematical formulas and expressions Another algebra is elementary algebra for example
