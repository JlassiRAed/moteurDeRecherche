 Pewter is an alloy made of tin mixed with antimony and copper It is soft and flexible and it can be melted easily It dissolves in hydrochloric acid to produce tin chloride leaving the antimony and copper behind in the hydrochloric acid A long time ago it was used to make knives forks spoons and other pieces of cutlery because it did not take much effort to melt down many times It used to contain poison ous lead but it does not contain lead anymore as the lead would make people ill when making things with pewter
