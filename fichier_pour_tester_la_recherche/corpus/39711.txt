See Amniote Taxonomy text The amniotes are a Taxonomy taxonomic group of animal s all the tetrapod s except amphibia They are the land vertebrate s which lay cleidoic egg s Two super groups make up the amniotes the Synapsida The embryo s of amniotes are either laid as Egg eggs or develop in the female These embyros are protected by several membrane s and have a much larger food supply than amphibian eggs The invention of the cleidoic egg and its embryonic membranes is the main reason why the eggs of an amniote do not need to be laid in water Thus as distinct from the amphibian s amniotes are truly terrestrial Secondarily many reptiles and mammals returned to water and mammals bear the young live as do some reptile groups This evolution ary flexibility is much less common in amphibians
