A Taylor series is an idea used in computer science calculus and other kinds of higher level mathematics It is a Series function looks like There is also a special kind of Taylor series called a Maclaurin series The theory behind the Taylor series is that if a point is chosen on the coordinate plane then it is possible to guess what a function will look like in the area around that point This is done by taking the derivative s of the function and adding them all together The idea is that it is possible to add the infinite number of derivatives and come up with a single finite sum In mathematics a Taylor series shows a Function function as an infinite sum The sum s terms are taken from the function s derivative s Taylor series come from Taylor s theorem
