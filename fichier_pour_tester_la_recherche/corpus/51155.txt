 The Shock of the Lightning is the first single off English Rock music rock band Oasis Oasis seventh and final studio album Dig Out Your Soul The song was released in September as a download and on September as a physical copy Lead guitarist Noel Gallagher said of the song If The Shock of the Lightning sounds instant and compelling to you it s because it was written dead fast And recorded dead fast The Shock of the Lightning basically is the demo And it has retained its energy And there s a lot to be said for that I think The first time you record something is always the best NME ranked the song on their list of Tracks of the Decade
