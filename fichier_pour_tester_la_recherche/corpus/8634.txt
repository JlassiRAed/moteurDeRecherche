 Physical compression means that a material under compressive stress reduces its volume There are different uses of compression in physics and engineering By compression it is possible to measure mechanical properties of materials such as compressive strength or modulus of elasticity Scientist Scientists do this with press machines Compression is also used in engine s for example in the Diesel engine as in any internal combustion engine and in the steam engine
