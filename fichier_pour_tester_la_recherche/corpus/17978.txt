 The half life of a substance is the time it takes for half of the substance to decay The word half life was first used when talking about radioactive chemical element elements where the number of atom s get smaller over time It is now used in many other situations A Geiger Muller detector can be used to measure the half life it is the time when the activity is half of the original Note that half life is defined as a probability Half life is the expected value when half the number of atoms have decayed Carbon has a half life of years Taking one atom of C this will either have decayed after years or it will not But if this experiment is repeated again and again it will be seen that the atom decays within the half life of the time Radioactive atoms have unstable nuclei Their nuclei are unstable because the arrangement of protons and neutrons in them are unsteady making them shake until that they begin to decay and change into completely different types of atoms by releasing certain types of radioactive particles such as alpha particles beta particles or gamma rays and possibly by fissioning into smaller nuclei This is known as radioactive decay For example a radioactive carbon atom releases a beta particle to become nitrogen As an example of fission decay a Fermium atom can split into Xenon and Palladium atoms releasing neutrons in the process As an example Uranium U which is used to find the age of fossil s has a half life of years
