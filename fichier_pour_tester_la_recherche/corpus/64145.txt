The notochord is a flexible rod shaped body found in embryo s of all chordate s It forms the axis of the embryo In some chordates it persists throughout life as the main support down the length of the body In most vertebrates it is replaced by the vertebral column The notochord is found ventral Notochords were the first backbones in chordates Notochords were advantageous to primitive fish ancestors they were a rigid structure for muscle attachment but flexible enough to allow movement Embryos of vertebrates have notochords and develop the vertebral column later
