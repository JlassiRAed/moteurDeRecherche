 Xylem is a tissue pipes hollow and rigid Xylem is one of two tissues in the plant which transportation transport substances that plants need to live Substances that xylem transports include water and minerals obtained through the plant s roots as xylem runs from the root s to the Plant stem stems and leaf leaves The other transport tissue is the phloem which transports energy in the form of sugar from the leaves to the rest of the plant Xylem cell s are present in all parts of a plant in stems roots and leaves Water is carried against gravity by the negative pressure that builds up through the process of transpiration which is the evaporation of moisture in leaves Xylem consists of four types of cells Xylem parenchyma which are living cells with thin walls Xylem fibres Tracheids Xylem vessels Most of these cells are dead cells and have thick walls
