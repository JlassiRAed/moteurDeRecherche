 Token Ring is a networking protocol for Local area network Local area networks It uses a token at the data link layer The token has two states either it is free or it is taken and data follows When a computer has a message to send it appends the message to the token and sets the token state to taken Each workstation along the ring sees the message If the workstation was the recipient of the message it sends a new empty token otherwise it passes the token along Since the only way to send data is to wait for an empty token there will be no collisions Token Ring was mainly used by IBM in the s to s today Ethernet has replaced it in many applications
