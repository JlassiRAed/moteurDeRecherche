In chemistry valence electrons are the electron s in the outside or valence electron shell of an atom Valence electrons are important in how a chemical element reacts with other elements Elements which have eight valence electrons are inert and they do not tend to create chemical reaction s with other elements in the Periodic table group The number of valence electrons is also important for determining the group of an element in the Periodic table because an element s number of valence electron is the same as the number of its group in the periodic table To calculate the amount of valence electrons present in an element you have to find the last number of the electron configuration
