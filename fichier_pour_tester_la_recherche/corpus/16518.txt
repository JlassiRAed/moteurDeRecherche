The speed of sound is per second in dry air in room temperature Sound moves faster through liquids and solids than air since liquids and solids can be pushed together more Sound cannot travel through a vacuum which is a space without any air or matter The speed of sound is affected by temperature It travels slower at low temperature s for example in the stratosphere You can calculate the speed of sound like this Where is the ratio of specific heats R is the gas constant T is temperature The speed of sound is also known as Mach number Mach Things that go faster are supersonic
