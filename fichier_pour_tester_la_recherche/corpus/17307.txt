In computer science an alphabet is a finite set finite empty set non empty set The element s of an alphabet are called the letters or symbols of the alphabet An example of an alphabet is which may be used for Morse code or begin if else for while which may be the keyword s of a Programming language The set of natural number s is not an alphabet because as it is not finite The alphabet which is used the most in computer science is It is called the binary alphabet because it contains two symbols An alphabet can be used to make a String This is a finite Sequence of letters from the alphabet For example a string of length over is The empty string is the string containing no letters The empty string is a string over any alphabet If we have an alphabet called It is named after the mathematician Stephen Cole Kleene The Kleene star of the binary alphabet is The three dots after show that we cannot write the Kleene star of an alphabet in full because it is an infinite set Alphabets are important because they are used in studying formal language s finite automata and very difficult questions in computer science about what can be computed and what can not
