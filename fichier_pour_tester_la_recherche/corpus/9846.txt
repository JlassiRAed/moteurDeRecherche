 Glycolysis is a metabolism metabolic process in most organisms It is the first stage in cellular respiration It allows both Aerobics aerobic and anaerobic respiration Glycolysis releases only a small amount of energy Glycolysis is thought to be the archetype of a universal metabolism metabolic pathway It occurs with variations in nearly all organisms both aerobic and anaerobic The wide occurrence of glycolysis shows that it is one of the most ancient known metabolic pathways Glycolysis has ten intermediate compounds catalysis catalysed by ten different enzyme s Only the broad outline is described here
