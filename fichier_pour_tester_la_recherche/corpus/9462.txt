 Heterochrony trait appears in the growth of an organism or to the timing of gene expression in morphogenesis development Its importance in biology is to explain the way closely related animals may come to have quite large differences in shape and size whilst nevetheless having a rather similar genome The main components are the time a process starts and stops in development and the rate at which the process works In his book Embryos and evolution B preprint Changes to the gene s which control timing in development can produce quite striking changes in the adult de Beer also conceived the idea of clandestine evolution which helped to explain the sudden changes in the fossil record which were apparently at odds with Darwin s gradual theory of evolution If a novelty were to evolve gradually in an animal s juvenile form then its development would not appear in the fossil record at all Then if the species were to undergo neoteny the feature would appear suddenly in the fossil record despite having evolved gradually Stephen Jay Gould commented on this book In a series of remarkable books that established the Modern evolutionary synthesis synthetic theory of evolution Gavin de Beer s Embryology and evolution was the first and the shortest In pages de Beer brought embryology into the developing orthodoxy for more than forty years this book has dominated English thought on the relationship between ontogeny and phylogeny Stephen Gould
