The greater bird of paradise is a bird of paradise in the genus Paradisaea Carolus Linnaeus named the species Paradisaea apoda or legless bird of paradise Apparently early trade skins to reach Europe were prepared without wings or feet by natives This led to the stary that these birds were beautiful visitors from paradise kept aloft by their plumes and never touched the earth until death The relevant point is that they were killed and traded for their feathers
