 Elasmosaurus was a foot foot long swim ming reptile that lived in the North American Inland Sea It was a plesiosaur It was first discovered in by a scientist named Edward Drinker Cope who accidentally put the head on the tail It had cervical vertebrae It was suggested by D M S Watson that their method was as surface swimmers mostly eating with their head above water darting down to snatch smaller fish which were feeding on plankton It is hard to see the benefit of a long neck under water Aquatic mammal s operating under water all have a streamlined torpedo shape as did pliosaurs and ichthyosaur s All the longer necked families were from the setting of the teeth and jaw s eaters of small fish The large number of neck vertebrae is probably linked to the modest degree of flexibility between adjacent vertebrae
