 Escape velocity is the initial speed that something would need to completely escape the gravity of a large body like a star or a planet by mere inertia If a ball is thrown upwards while standing on the ground the ball will reach a certain height space farther and farther away from the Earth The minimum speed at which this could happen is called the escape velocity The escape velocity at the surface of the Earth is kilometer s per second drag This is of course a very high speed compared to how fast a ball can be thrown Even a bullet shot into the sky will fall back down because its initial speed of nearly kilometer per second is far from escape velocity Spacecraft starting from the surface of Earth has a zero initial speed But if it has enough fuel it may be permanently Acceleration accelerated by its Rocket engine engine until it reaches escape velocity Then it will travel into space even after the engine is shut off
