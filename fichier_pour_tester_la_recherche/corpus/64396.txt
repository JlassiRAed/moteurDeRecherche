 Velvet is a type of woven tufted textile fabric in which the cut yarn thread s are very evenly distributed with a short dense nap pile giving it a distinctly smooth feel Velvet can be made from many different fibres It is woven on a special loom that weaves two pieces of velvet at the same time The two pieces are then cut apart and the two lengths of fabric are wound on separate take up rolls Velvet is difficult to clean due to its pile but modern dry cleaning methods perform well Velvet is made ideally from silk More recently synthetic velvets have been developed mostly polyester nylon viscose acetate and mixtures of different synthetics or synthetics and natural fibers A small percentage of lycra is used sometimes to give stretch
