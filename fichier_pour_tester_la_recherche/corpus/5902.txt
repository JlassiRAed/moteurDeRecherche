An earthquake Earth s crust They can be extremely violent Earthquakes are usually quite brief but may repeat They are the result of a sudden release of energy in the Earth s crust This creates seismic waves which are waves of energy that travel through the Earth The study of earthquakes is called seismology Seismology studies the frequency type and size of earthquakes over a period of time There are large earthquakes and small earthquakes Large earthquakes can take down buildings and cause death and injury Earthquakes are measured using observations from seismometer s The magnitude of an earthquake and the intensity of shaking is usually reported on the Richter scale On the scale or less is scarcely noticeable and magnitude causes damage over a wide area An earthquake under the ocean can cause a tsunami This can cause just as much death and destruction as the earthquake itself Landslide s can happen too Earthquakes are part of the Earth s rock cycle
