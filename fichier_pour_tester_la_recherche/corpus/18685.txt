This is a list of dinosaur s whose remains have been recovered from Africa Africa has a rich fossil record but it is patchy and incomplete Prosauropods dating from the Early Triassic period about million years ago have been discovered in Madagascar Africa is rich in Triassic and Lower Jurassic dinosaurs African dinosaurs from these time periods include Megapnosaurus Syntarsus Dracovenator Melanorosaurus Massospondylus Euskelosaurus Heterodontosaurus Abrictosaurus and Lesothosaurus The Middle Jurassic is poorly represented in Africa Only the three sauropods Cetiosaurus Lapparentosaurus and Archaeodontosaurus have been discovered dating from this time period The Upper Jurassic however is well represented in Africa mainly thanks to the spectacular Tendaguru Tendaguru Formation Allosaurus Ceratosaurus Elaphrosaurus Giraffatitan Dicraeosaurus Janenschia Tornieria Tendaguria Kentrosaurus and Dryosaurus are among the dinosaurs whose remains have been recovered from Tendaguru This fauna seems to show strong similarities to that of the Morrison Formation in the United States and the Lourinha Formation in Portugal For example Allosaurus Ceratosaurus and Dryosaurus have been found in both the Tendaguru and the Morrison This has important biogeographical implications The Lower Cretaceous in Africa is known primarily from the northern part of the continent particularly Niger Suchomimus Elrhazosaurus Spinostropheus Rebbachisaurus Nigersaurus Kryptops Nqwebasaurus and Paranthodon are some of the early Cretaceous dinosaurs known from Africa The early Cretaceous was an important time for the dinosaurs of Africa because it was when Africa finally separated from South America forming the South Atlantic Ocean This was an important event because now the dinosaurs of Africa started developing endemism because of isolation The Upper Cretaceous of Africa is known mainly from North Africa During the early part of the Upper Cretaceous North Africa was home to a rich dinosaur fauna It includes Spinosaurus Carcharodontosaurus Rugops Bahariasaurus Deltadromeus Paralititan Aegyptosaurus and Ouranosaurus During the latest Cretaceous at the end of the Age of Dinosaurs Majungasaurus Masiakasaurus Rapetosaurus and the flying dromaeosaurid Rahonavis lived in Africa
