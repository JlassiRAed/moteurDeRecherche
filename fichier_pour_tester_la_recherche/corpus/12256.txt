 Geophysics Some geophysicists now also study the hydrological cycle including snow and ice They study how the oceans and the atmosphere move They study electricity and magnetism in the atmosphere ionosphere and magnetosphere How the earth and sun affect each other is also part of geophysics Geophysics was only recognized as a special area of study in the th century But there were geophysicists in ancient history The first magnetic compasses were made in the fourth century BC and the first seismoscope was built in BC Isaac Newton applied his theory of mechanics to the tide s and the precession of the equinox Instruments were developed to measure the Earth s shape density and gravity field as well as parts of the water cycle In the th century geophysical methods were developed for remote exploration of the solid Earth and the ocean Studying geophysics may help with problems such as mineral resources reducing natural hazard s and protecting the environment Geophysical surveying survey data help find petroleum reservoirs mineral deposits groundwater and archaeological relics Such data can also tell the thickness of glaciers and soils and tell which areas have environmental damage that should be fixed
