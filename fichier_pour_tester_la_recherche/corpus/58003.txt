An electrical insulator is a material that will not easily conduct an electric current Materials typically used to insulate include rubber plastic and glass In transformer s and electric motor s varnish is used Insulating gas es such as Sulfur hexafluoride are used in some switch es Wire s that carry electric currents are usually insulated so the electricity goes to the right place Insulator can mean not only the material but things that are made of that material They are made of various materials such as glass silicone rubber plastic oil wood dry cotton quartz ceramic etc The type of insulator will depend on the uses Insulators have high electrical resistivity and low conductivity The insulators prevent the loss of current and make the current more efficient by concentrating the flow
