A solid state drive A HDD can usually be directly replaced with a SSD The best thing about solid state drives is that they have a much faster read write speed than hard disk drives They also have no moving parts which means they don t make noise or break as easily Unfortunately SSDs are much more expensive than hard disk drives This also means that for the same price someone can get much more capacity if they select a HDD instead A hybrid drive combines the features of an HDD and an SSD into one unit It contains a large HDD and a smaller SSD cache to improve performance of frequently accessed files A hybrid drive can offer almost the same performance as an SSD and it can contain more capacity The price is also lower than of an SSD The solid state drive technology is improving quickly and new SSD models are being introduced often Not all computers have an SSD
