In computing a cluster is made of many individual computers that work together to solve a problem at hand Clusters can have different forms They can be whole computers working together or only CPU s These CPUs can communicate over a fast network but they share the same hard disk s for example Depending on the problem solving it with a cluster of cheaper component s can be less expensive that investing in better hardware that costs more Grid computing is different in that the individual computers work on separate tasks that are part of a large problem They are usually more different from one another and geographically further apart than cluster computers are
