 Thixotropy is the property of certain gel s or fluid s that are thick when shaken agitated or otherwise stressed In more technical language some Non Newtonian fluid s show a change in viscosity the longer the fluid undergoes shear stress the lower its viscosity A thixotropic fluid is a fluid which takes a finite time to attain equilibrium viscosity when introduced to a step change in shear rate Many gel s and colloid s are thixotropic materials exhibiting a stable form at rest but becoming fluid when agitated Some fluids are anti thixotropic constant shear stress for a time causes an increase in viscosity or even solidification Constant shear stress can be applied by shaking or mixing They are much less common
