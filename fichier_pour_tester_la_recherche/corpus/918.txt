 Defibrillation is the act of defibrillating the heart to treatment treat the heart when it is not pushing blood because the heart muscle is not working in any pattern Electricity causes a muscle to contract this is how nerves cause muscles to work The heart is a large muscle and certain parts need to contract before other parts in order to push blood through the heart and out to the rest of body correctly Sometimes the heart muscle doesn t contract in the correct way or at the correct speed this is called an arrhythmia can get blood to the body when the heart is fibrillating but the heart still needs to be restarted Sometimes CPR will do that as well but often a defibrillator is needed Defibrillation is done with a defibrillator Defibrillation works by carefully sending a strong electric current to the heart which resets the heart and hopefully returns a normal coordinated heart rhythm It needs to depolarise from a large part of the heart muscle which stops the arrhythmia and allows the normal heartbeat to return Defibrillators can work outside the body with the use of an defibrillator external defibrillator or an automated external defibrillator or inside the body with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator
