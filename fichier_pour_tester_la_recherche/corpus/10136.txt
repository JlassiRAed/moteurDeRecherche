 Black body radiation is radiation produced by heated objects particularly from a kind of special object that is made so it will absorb all radiation that falls on it and so that it will also radiate at all frequency frequencies that heat energy produces in it This part of the story of radiation was first explained by James Clerk Maxwell via wave theory but the predicted and actual intensity vs frequency curves did not go together right Because the way of classical physics did not work Max Planck explained their relationship by saying that there are individual things n that were vibrating at a given frequency f times a special constant h that turns frequency units into energy units The equation is E n h f The constant he made h is called the Planck constant The idea that a unit of light at a given frequency always has the same energy the idea that there is a quantum of energy for each unit of light at a given frequency became the doorway into quantum mechanics so the idea of a black body is something that is basic to modern physics It shows up in discussions of a wide variety of physics topics having to do with energies and frequencies
