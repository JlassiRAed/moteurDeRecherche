An Automaton is a concept from mathematics Sometimes the concept is called state machine It is like an abstract machine Such a machine can be given input which is either rejected or accepted It s like a vending machine When something is bought coin s needs to be inserted into the machine If these are the right coins they are accepted and the requested item is dropped so it can be removed If the coins are wrong they are rejected Internally the automaton has different states it can be in Feeding it input may at a time When no symbol is left the automaton is in a certain state This may be an final state In this case the input is accepted Otherwise the input is rejected If the machine has a countable finite number of states it is called finite state machine A diagram that shows all the states and transitions of such a machine is called finite state diagram
