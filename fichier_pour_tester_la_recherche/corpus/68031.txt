A colorimeter is a device used for measuring colours or colorimetry It measures the absorbance of different wavelength s of light in a solution It can be used to measure the concentration of a known solute Different chemical substances absorb different wavelengths of light When the concentration of the solute is higher it absorbs more light in a specific wavelength This is known as the Beer Lambert law
