 Short term memory is the ability to keep information in mind for a short amount time such as remembering a phone number long enough to find a piece of paper The mind is able to store memory that is learned recently for a small period of time for use again The amount of time the mind is able to do this is usually within seconds The opposite of short term memory is long term memory which is where things can be stored in the mind for a long time to be recalled later
