The Bridge of Sighs and built in The view from the windows of the Bridge of Sighs was the last view of Venice that convict s saw before their prison imprisonment The bridge was named by Lord Byron in the th century It was thought that prisoners would sigh at their final view of beautiful Venice through the windows before being taken down to their cells In reality the days of inquisition s and summary executions were over by the time the bridge was built and the cells under the palace roof were occupied mostly by small time criminals In addition little could be seen from inside the Bridge due to the stone grills covering the windows A local legend says that lovers will be granted everlasting love and bliss if they kiss on a gondola at sunset under the bridge
