 Solid geometry is the geometry of three dimensional Euclidean space It includes the measurement s of volume s of various solid figures prisms It is Euclidean geometry but not plane Points are defined as a defined position on a sphere A staight line is the shortest path between two points which stays on the surface of the sphere Euclid s account of spherical geometry is in his Euclid s Elements Elements volumes XIXIII containing solid geometry and in his lesser known work the Phaenomena which includes geometric propositions The actual discoveries were often made by others The Pythagoreanism Pythagoreans dealt with the Regular solid regular solids like the cube and the sphere The pyramid prism cone and cylinder were not studied until the Platonism Platonists Eudoxus of Cnidus Eudoxus proved the pyramid and cone have one third the volume of a prism and cylinder on the same base and of the same height The equations for area s and volumes in two and three dimensions was proof proved by Archimedes One of Archimedes works was called On the sphere and the cylinder He asked that a carving of the two solid figures be placed on his tomb He specified a right circular cylinder with height equal to its circumference because he had used this in his proof
