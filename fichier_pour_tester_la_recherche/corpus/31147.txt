In chemistry a superbase is an extremely strong Base base It is a compound that has a high affinity for proton s Hydroxide ion is the strongest base possible in water solutions but superbases are much stronger than aqueous bases Such bases are useful in organic synthesis and are wikt fundamental fundamental to physical chemistry physical organic chemistry Superbases have been described and used since the s Chemical reaction Reactions involving superbases often require special techniques since they are destroyed by water carbon dioxide and oxygen in the air Inert atmosphere techniques and low temperature s minimize these side reactions
