In Economics a public good is a kind of Common good common good Public goods have two main properties It is not possible to prevent someone from consuming the good If a person consumes the good this does not reduce the availabililty of the good to others Examples for public goods are fresh air knowledge street lighting or a fireworks display Public goods are an example of market failure If all actors maximize their gain this does not produce an efficient solution It is obvious that because the goods are non excludable it means that a producer sees no benefit in producing or providing the good on the market this is because it is impossible to make a profit from it as people who have not paid for the good For this reason the government may intervene to provide it There are relatively few examples of purely public goods however some examples are Flood Control Public water supplies Street lighting Lighthouse protection National Defence Services Parks and other public recreational aresThe reason that the government feels the need to provide these goods is because the Marginal Social Benefit is greater than the Marginal Private Benefit and so because there are positive externalities in consumption it will always be under consumed in the market mechanism
