 Heta a letter of the Greek alphabet and also for some other variant forms of it This name is used to show that this letter at first was pronounced as h just like in Latin Later in the Ionian dialect of Greek people stopped pronouncing the sound h and therefore they gave the letter a new meaning and used it for a long e sound instead Some other dialects then took over this new letter Eta and so they had to find a new form for the letter for h In some dialects they invented a new letter to stand for h Today the name Heta is also used for this letter
