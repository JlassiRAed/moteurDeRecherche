In computer engineering computer architecture is the conceptual design and fundamental operational structure of a computer system It is the technical drawings and functional description of all design requirements operates internally and how it accesses RAM addresses in memory It can be defined as the science and art of selecting and interconnecting hardware components to create computers that meet functional performance and cost goals Computer architecture includes at least three main subcategories Instruction set Instruction set architecture or ISA is the abstract model of a computing system that is seen by a machine language programmer including the instruction set addressing mode memory address modes processor register s and address and data formats Microarchitecture also known as Computer organization is a lower level a detailed description of the system that is sufficient for completely describing the operation of all parts of the computer computing system and how they are inter connected and inter operate in order to implement the ISA The size of a computer s cache for instance is an organizational issue that generally has nothing to do with the ISA System Design which includes all of the other hardware components within a computer computing system such as Once both Instruction set ISA and microarchitecture has been specified the actual computer computing system needs to be designed into hardware This design process is called implementation Implementation is usually a hardware engineering design process Implementation can be further broken down into three but not fully separate pieces For CPU s the entire implementation process is often called CPU design it can also be a family of related CPU designs such as RISC and CISC
