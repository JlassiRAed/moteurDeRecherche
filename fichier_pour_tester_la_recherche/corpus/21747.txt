The Printer Command Language is a page description language developed by Hewlett Packard As of most modern printers understand PCL Its complexity is between pure ASCII text such as in ESC P and for example Postscript There are different versions of the language Common versions PCL PCL Can use raster graphics raster description of font s grayscale dpi output maximum PCLc PCLc Supports color in addition to PCL PCL PCLGUI Allows compression of raster images is not compatible with other PCL standards PCL Macro s bigger bitmap s introduction of graphics PCL Supports graphics in HPGL fonts can be resized PCLe Supports bidirectional communication with the printer supports the windows fonts PCLc Color version of PCLe supports different color palettes and the option to select different colors PCL XL later renamed to PCL enhanced Allows compression to increase throughput This is a stack based object oriented programming object oriented programming language similar to Postscript PCL standard Either PCLe or PCLc for backwards compatibility Jet Ready Lowcost version of PCL XL Only supports JFIF images Allows to build printers without raster image processor and without a lot of memory The Rasterization is done in the computer the printer only prints images Except where stated PCL versions are downwards compatible A printer that supports PCL can also be programmed using PCL for example PCL is a very efficient way of coding For this reason certain manufacturers build high volume printers that support different versions of PCL Such printers can do more than pages per minute
