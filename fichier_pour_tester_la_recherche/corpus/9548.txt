 Approximation theory is a field of mathematics which is concerned with approximation approximating the values of a function function Usually the approximation is only needed for a range of values or domain A good approximation will only have a small error in the domain of interest There are different ways in which this approximation is done common ones are using a combination of simpler functions or using polynomial s
