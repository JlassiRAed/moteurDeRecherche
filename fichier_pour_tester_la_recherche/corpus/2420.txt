The Chernobyl disaster was a nuclear disaster which occurred on April at the Chernobyl power plant nuclear power plant in Pripyat Ukraine At that time Ukraine was part of the Soviet Union The event was the worst nuclear accident accident in the history of nuclear power Because there was no containment building to trap the radiation radioactivity radioactive nuclear fallout fallout drifted over parts of the western Soviet Union Eastern Europe Scandinavia the United Kingdom UK and the eastern United States Large areas of Ukraine Belarus and Russia were badly contaminated About of the radioactive fallout landed in Belarus cite webBefore the accident there was a planned power reduction By the beginning of the day shift the power level had reached Following this randomly one of the regional power stations went offline It was then requested that the further power reduction would be postponed Despite this request the reduction and preparations for a test that was to happen continued The accident occurred when the fourth reactor suffered a voltage spike huge power increase This led to the core of the reactor exploding Due to this explosion large amounts of radioactive materials and fuel were released into the atmosphere This lit the combustable graphite moderator on fire This fire greatened the release of radioactive material which was carried by the smoke of the fire into the environment and atmosphere Reactor is now covered by a sarcophagus made from steel and concrete to stop the escape of more radiation from elements such as corium uranium and plutonium as well as radioactive dust The sarcophagus is to be replaced with the New Safe Confinement structure The accident raised concerns about the safety of the Soviet nuclear power industry The Soviet Union slowed down the process of making its nuclear industry bigger for some time The Soviet government also had to become less secretive as a result of the accident Since then Russia Ukraine and Belarus have become separate countries Those countries have been burdened with continuing costs for decontamination and health care because of the accident Exposure to radiation leads to a higher risk of getting cancer It is difficult to accurately tell the number of deaths caused by the events at Chernobyl The Chernobyl accident happened when some workers were testing the safety of the reactor Some of the devices that stopped the reactor from blowing up were switched off Then there was a power surge they lost control and the reactor blew up Most of the people affected have not died yet When and if the people involved die of cancer or related diseases it will be hard to tell if this was because of the accident A International Atomic Energy Agency IAEA report tells of direct deaths of those were accident workers and were children who died of thyroid cancer The report estimates that up to people may die from long term diseases related to the accident Greenpeace along with others thinks that the study s conclusions may be false
