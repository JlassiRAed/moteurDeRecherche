An analog signal processor is used to quickly Signal processing process Signal signals that can be too complex to handle any other way A comparator is used to offer level triggers correct down to microvolt s with reaction times in the picosecond s Analog signal Analog filters offer anti aliasing in sampled value systems as inputs and outputs and can be used as Anti aliasing filter pre filters in audio and communications Analog multiplier s and dividers are used to offer brief gain control Radiometry radiometric function or continuous energy measurement with surprising accuracy Over voltage protection applications can protect the front end of analog transmission receiver systems multiplexers Amplification and filtering for noise removal are the main feature of analog signal processing tech stub
