 Geothermal energy is energy made by heat inside the Earth s crust It s clean and sustainable Although the Sun does heat the surface of the Earth heat from inside the Earth is not caused by the Sun The geothermal energy of the Earth s Crust crust comes from the original formation of the planet and from the radioactive decay of minerals The Earth is hottest at its Earth s core core and from the core to the surface the temperature gets gradually cooler Resources of geothermal energy range from the shallow ground to hot water and hot rock found a few miles beneath the Earth s surface and down even deeper to the extremely high temperatures of molten rock called magma It has been used for bath ing from Paleolithic times but is now better known for making electricity All over the world geothermal energy has been used to make about gigawatt s of electricity in and give of the electricity needed around the world When used to generate electricity geothermal power plants typically offer constant output Geothermal energy is also used directly for district heating or in other heating and cooling applications Buildings in Iceland are heated in this way from the country s many geothermal sites Power plants and thermal applications of geothermal energy are mature technologies whereas enhanced geothermal system s projects are a new type of application Almost everywhere the shallow ground or upper feet and a heat exchanger a system of pipes buried in the shallow ground near the building In the winter the heat pump removes heat from the heat exchanger and pumps it into the indoor air delivery system In the summer the process is reversed and the heat pump moves heat from the indoor air into the heat exchanger The heat removed from the indoor air during the summer can also be used to provide a free source of hot water Geothermal energy escapes as hot water at many hot spring s or as steam at geyser s In the United States most geothermal reservoirs of hot water are in the western states Alaska and Hawaii Wells can be drilled into underground reservoirs for the generation of electricity Some geothermal power plants use the steam from a reservoir to power a turbine generator while others use the hot water to boil a working fluid that vaporizes and then turns a turbine Hot water near the surface of Earth can be used directly for heat Direct use applications include heating buildings growing plants in greenhouses drying crops heating water at fish farms and several industrial processes such as pasteurizing milk Hot dry rock resources occur at depths of to miles everywhere beneath the Earth s surface and at lesser depths in certain areas Access to these resources involves injecting cold water down one well circulating it through hot fractured rock and drawing off the heated water from another well Currently nobody uses this method commercially Existing technology also does not yet allow recovery of heat directly from magma the very deep and most powerful resource of geothermal energy
