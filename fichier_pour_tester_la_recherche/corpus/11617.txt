An iceberg is a large piece of ice floating in the sea They are generally found in cold water near the North Pole North or South Pole Icebergs are especially common during Spring spring when ice has begun to melt About of an iceberg is below the water line and ten percent above Just by looking at the part you can see it is hard to tell how the part underwater looks and how close you can get before crashing into it Icebergs break off from larger structures made of ice like glacier s or ice shelf ice shelves These are formed by snowfall in very cold places where it will not melt in the summer The snow builds up and compacts into ice This is gradually pulled downhill by gravity and into the sea The ice then falls off and makes icebergs The icebergs can drift in the sea for years before they have melted completely
