 Macroevolution refers to large scale evolution For some this means the origin of species For others it means the large scale changes seen in the fossil record Major changes in structure and ways of life over tens of millions of years R L Carroll A large evolutionary pattern events that result in the origin of a new higher taxon Dictionary of Genetics All macroevolutionary process es take place in populations and in the genotype s of individuals and are thus simultaneously microevolutionary processes Mayr A vague term for the evolution of great Phenotype phenotypic changes usually great enough to put the lineage into a distinct genus or higher taxon Futuyma Evolution on the grand scale Ridley It is a term of convenience for most biologists it does not suggest any change in the process of evolution Some biologists use the term for evolution in already separated gene pool s For them macroevolutionary studies focus on change that occurs at or above the level of species Again this is a minority position Most biologist would not call evolution at the species level macroevolution Microevolution Changes in gene frequency in populations is a by product of what happens to individuals
