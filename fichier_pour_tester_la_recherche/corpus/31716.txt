 The Crustacea are a sub phylum of arthropod s with described species They are part of the phylum Arthropoda Crustaceans include crab s lobster s crayfish shrimp krill and barnacle s They are relatives of insects If the Arthropods are regarded as a superphylum then the insects and crustaces would be phyla The group has an extensive fossil record reaching back to the Cambrian Most crustaceans are aquatic mostly Ocean marine Some have moved onto land permanently Crustaceans that live on land include some crabs and woodlice Crustacea range in size from a parasite mm long to the Japanese spider crab with a leg span of up to ft The North Atlantic lobster can weigh more than pounds Most crustaceans are mobile but some become sessile after their larva l stage Barnacles become attached to rocks on thesea shore Some are parasite parasitic like fish lice and tongue worm s Crustacea usually have separate sexes and the eggs hatch into larvae Crustaceans have three major body parts They are front to back head thorax and abdomen Generally they have two pairs of antenna e two eye s and three pairs of jaws on their head Most breathe with gill s although certain land crab s have developed lung s Lobster s and crab s have hard outer skeletons and tend to preserve well as fossil s As adults they moult their shells as they grow in size Most crustaceans crawl along the bottoms of streams rivers and the ocean sometimes coming on land Because they move along the ground under the water they are called benthic creatures Even though lobster s and shrimp s can swim a bit they usually walk along the bottom of the body of water in which they live More than million tons of crustaceans are produced by fishery or farming for human consumption the majority of it being shrimps and prawns Krill and copepod s are not as widely fished but may be the animals with the greatest biomass on the planet and form a vital part of the food chain
