In economics an oligopoly is a Market forms market form in which the market or industry is controlled by a small number of sales sell ers Usually the market has high barriers to entry which prevents new firms from entering the market or even be able to have a significant market share As there are only a few sellers in the market each seller would take note of the actions made by one another and thinks about how the other sellers will respond when making decisions As such there is a possibility in which an oligopoly can come together to make a common decision that allows them to have less competition and charge higher prices for consumers
