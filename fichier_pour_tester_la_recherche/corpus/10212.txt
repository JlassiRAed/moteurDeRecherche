 Atmospheric pressure is a force in an area pushed against a surface by the weight of air in Earth s atmosphere The earth is covered in a layer of air However this layer is not distributed evenly around the globe At different times the layer of air is thicker in some places than in others Where the layer of air is thicker there is more air Since there is more air there is a higher pressure in that spot Where the layer of air is thinner there is a lower atmospheric pressure The higher the altitude the thinner the air is and the lower the atmospheric pressure is This is because high places do not have as much air above them pushing down Barometer s can be used to measure atmospheric pressure Cite web url title atmospheric pressure Britannica Online Encyclopedia work britannica com
