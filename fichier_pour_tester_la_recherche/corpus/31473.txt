A dyke in geology is a type of later vertical rock between older layers of rock Technically it is any geologic body which cuts across Dikes can therefore be either pushed in between in origin The most usual thing that happens is that later volcanic activity pushes lava through strata which were laid down earlier in a sedimentary fashion or through earlier igneous rocks On the Isle of Arran for example there are hundreds of igneous dykes giving rise to the term dyke swarm Alternatively sedimentary rocks can be laid down in vertical gaps between strata Or after underwater earthquakes gaps caused by the earthquake can be filled in with breccia that is broken rocks Dykes are a common almost universal feature of the older Palaeozoic rocks Another type of Intrusion sill where later rock is formed between older layers not through them
