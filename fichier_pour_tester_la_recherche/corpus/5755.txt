 Candidatus Carsonella ruddii is an Endosymbiosis endosymbiotic Gammaproteobacteria gamma proteobacterium The species is an endosymbiont that is present in all species of phloem sap feeding insects known as psyllid s The endosymbionts occurs in a specialised structure known as the bacteriome In the genome of one strain of Ca C ruddi was sequenced at RIKEN in Japan and the University of Arizona The genome is a circular chromosome of base pair s and has a high coding density Numerous genes considered essential for life seem to be missing suggesting that the species may have achieved organelle like status In comparison Mycoplasma genitalium which has the smallest genome of any free living organism has a genome of genes
