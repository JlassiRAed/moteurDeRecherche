 Raster graphics is one of two kinds of computer graphics With raster graphics images are modeled as big collections of pixel s Usually they form an image shaped like a rectangle Each pixel holds something like color or transparency Raster images are used very often Computer screens are made of a raster of points vector graphics Vector graphic image s are rasterised that way Images that are difficult to make as a vector like photograph s are often made in the form of a raster image Many computer printer printers today use computer language s like Postscript or PCL These languages are based on vectorized images most of the time To be printed these images need to be translated into raster graphics first This is done by a part called a Raster Image Processor Most modern printers have those processors inside the printer Some printers use a special piece of software on the computer to do that job
