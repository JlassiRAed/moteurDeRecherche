 Deinosuchus is an extinct relative of the alligator which lived to million years ago in the Upper Cretaceous Period period The first remains were discovered in North Carolina in the s but it was not until that the genus was named and described Additional fragments were discovered in the s and were later made into an influential but inaccurate skull reconstruction at the American Museum of Natural History Knowledge of Deinosuchus is still incomplete but better skull material has been found in recent years Deinosuchus was far larger than any modern crocodile or alligator it was up to However its overall appearance was fairly similar to its modern relatives It had large robust teeth that were adapted to crushing and its back was covered with thick round bony plates One study suggests that Deinosuchus may have lived for up to years growing at a similar rate to that of modern crocodilians but growing for a much longer period Deinosuchus fossils have been found in ten U S state s as well as northern Mexico It lived on both sides of the Western Interior Seaway and was an ambush apex predator in the coastal regions of eastern North America Deinosuchus reached its largest size in its western habitat but the eastern populations were far more abundant Opinion remains divided as to whether these two populations represent separate species Deinosuchus was probably capable of killing and eating large dinosaur s It may have also fed upon sea turtle s fish and other aquatic and terrestrial prey
