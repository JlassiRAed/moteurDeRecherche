 Satellite DNA has many sections of repeating non coding DNA Satellite DNA is a type of tandem repeat The repeats sit next to each other in tandem These are multiple copies of the same base pair sequence lying end to end Copies of base pair sequences may be repeated one after another along a chromosome for example the S rRNA genes in somatic cell s of toad s of which there are about copies Adapted from Biology Online org Tandem Repeat at the US National Library of Medicine Medical Subject Headings microsatellite DNA Satellite DNA is the main component of centromeres It forms the main part of heterochromatin The most common type of tandem repeat is the heterochromatin which sits on chromosomes around the centromeres and elsewhere It is transcriptionally inactive meaning it does not code for proteins
