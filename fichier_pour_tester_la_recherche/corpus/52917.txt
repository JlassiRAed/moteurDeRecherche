In biology a medusa is a form of cnidaria n in which the body is shaped like an umbrella The other main body form is the polyp Medusae vary from bell shaped to the shape of a thin disk scarcely convex above and only slightly concave below The upper or aboral surface is called the exumbrella and the lower surface is called the subumbrella the mouth is on the lower surface which may be partially closed by a membrane extending inward from the margin The digestive cavity consists of the gastrovascular cavity and radiating canals which extend toward the margin these canals may be simple or branching and vary in number from few to many The margin of the disk bears sensory organs and tentacle s In the class Hydrozoa medusae are the sexual individuals of many species alternating in the life cycle with asexual polyps The medusa form of Hydrozoa ns are known as hydromedusae A polyp is the form that attaches to a surface while a medusa is the form that is free floating a species of cnidarian may take each form in a different phase of its life The medusa form predominates in the classes Scyphozoa and Cubozoa Except for freshwater hydrozoa ns like Craspedacusta sowerbyi these are the only classes in which medusae appear Medusae may have many tentacle s with which they catch their prey Sometimes people bathing in the ocean are touched by a medusa Their tentacles are long and thin and covered in venomous stinging cells They inject poison which paralysis immobilizes small fish People who are stung should seek medical attention There have been some deaths after severe medusa stings
