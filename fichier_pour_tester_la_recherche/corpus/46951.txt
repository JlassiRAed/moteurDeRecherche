In mathematics Gaussian elimination is a method used to solve system of linear equations systems of linear equations It is named after Carl Friedrich Gauss a famous German mathematician who wrote about this method but did not invent it To perform Gaussian elimination the coefficient s of the terms in the system of linear equations are used to create a type of matrix called an augmented matrix Then elementary row operations are used to simplify the matrix The three types of row operations used are The goal of Gaussian elimination is to get the matrix in row echelon form If a matrix is in row echelon form that means that reading from left to right each row will start with at least one more zero term than the row above it Some wikt definition definitions of Gaussian elimination say that the matrix result has to be in reduced row echelon form That means that the matrix is in row echelon form and the only non zero term in each row is Gaussian elimination that creates a reduced row echelon matrix result is sometimes called Gauss Jordan elimination
