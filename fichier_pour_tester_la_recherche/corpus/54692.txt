 Biology is the science that deals with living things In general Living things react to stimulus stimuli Living things interact with their environment which includes members of the same and other species Living things have a metabolism they take in food which they convert to the energy they need Living things reproduction reproduce they give birth to others of the same species This is not true of all individual organisms In eusocial organisms some castes cannot reproduce But since the sterile workers are all the produce of a single queen they are one collective Many things that appear to be one organism are in fact several living together An example is lichen Lichen is a symbiosis between a cyanobacteria blue green alga and a fungus Organisms that live together may not reproduce together but their life processes are bound up together They help each other to live
