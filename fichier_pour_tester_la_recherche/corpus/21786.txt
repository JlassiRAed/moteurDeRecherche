 Svecchachara is the Sanskrit equivalent of the Greek word Thelema interpreted by Aleister Crowley as Do What Thou Wilt In the first volume of the TWILIGHT YOGA Ecstasy Equipoise and Eternity Shri Gurudev Mahendranath wrote Sveccha means one s own wish or free will Svecchachara means a way of life where one acts as one wishes and does what is right in one s own eyes Doing one s own Will The concluding Sanskrit expression in the Avadhut Avadhoota Upanishad is Svecchachara Paro The term Paro means a mysterious or secret pattern to that action done by one s own Will In other words we do our Will but with discretion not making it too obvious nor to harm or hurt other people Yet this is also a typical Nathism a complete reversal of Vedic morals and philosophy
