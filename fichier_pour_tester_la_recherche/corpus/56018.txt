 Archimedes screw is a machine It is a type of pump used for raising water up It is a screw inside a fairly tight fitting cylinder With the bottom end in water the screw lifts water up to the top where it pours out of a spout The screw can be turned by hand or by a windmill or by an engine The screw is often used for filling irrigation ditches Archimedes wrote about it when he was in Alexandria Egypt It is not known for certain whether he did invent it but it is always attributed to him The Archimedes screw is still much in use all over the world There is also a kind of reverse Archimedes screw Water poured in on top turns the screw The turning drives an electric generator which makes electricity It is good for rivers with modest water drops The reverse screw has the same benefits as using the screw for pumping it can handle very dirty water and widely varying rates of flow with high efficiency
