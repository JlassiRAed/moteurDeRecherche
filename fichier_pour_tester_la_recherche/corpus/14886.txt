 Light is a type of energy It is a form of electromagnetic radiation of a wavelength which can be detected by the human eye It is a small part of the electromagnetic spectrum and radiation given off by stars like the sun Animals can also see light Light exists in tiny packets called photons It shows properties of both wave s and Particle physics particles The study of light known as optics is an important research area in modern physics Light is electromagnetic radiation that is in the form of a Wave wave Each wave has a wavelength or frequency The human eye sees each wavelength as a different color Rainbow s show the entire spectrum of visible light The separate colors moving in from the outer edges are usually listed as red orange yellow green blue indigo and violet Other colors can be seen only with special camera s or instrument s Wavelengths below the frequency of red are called infrared and higher than of violet are called ultraviolet The other main properties of light are intensity intensity polarization phase and orbital angular momentum In physics the term light sometimes refers to electromagnetic radiation of any wavelength whether visible or not This article is about visible light Read the electromagnetic radiation article for the general concept
