An exothermic reaction is a chemical reaction where the wikt substance substances reacting release energy as heat An example of this is combustion Exothermic reactions transfer energy to the surroundings The reaction that does the complete opposite is an endothermic reaction The energy is usually transferred as heat energy causing the reaction mixture and its surroundings to become hotter The temperature increase can be detected using a thermometer Some examples of exothermic reactions are burning respiration neutralisation reactions between acid s and alkali s the reaction between water and calcium oxide
