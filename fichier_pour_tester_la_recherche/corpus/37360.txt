 Control engineering is the engineering field that focuses on mathematical model ing of systems of a various nature analyzing their dynamic behavior and using control theory to create a controller that will cause the systems to behave in a desired manner Modern control engineering is closely related to electrical electronic and computer engineering as electronic circuits can often be easily explained using control theory techniques And as engineering is developing control engineering is often wanted In most of the cases control engineers make use of feedback when designing control systems For example in an automobile with sail control the machine s speed is continuously checked and fed back to the system which adjusts the motor s spin power accordingly Also recently control system is used in nanotechnology And the field of control within chemical engineering is known as process control For example we can change chemical process fast and easily Many developments were invoked by this process control Like this control engineering has a lot if fields that include science finance management and even human action The important thing of control engineering is feedback But control engineers may also work on the control of systems without feedback This is called open loop control An open loop controller also called a non feedback controller is a type of controller which works out what to into a system using only the current condition and its model of the system An example of open loop control is a washing machine that works through a scheduled cycle without the use of units
