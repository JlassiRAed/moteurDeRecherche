The Earth is shaped by many different Geology geological processes The Force forces that cause these processes come from both above and beneath the Earth s surface Processes that are caused by forces from within the Earth are endogenous processes By contrast exogenous processes come from forces on or above the Earth s surface Endo is a prefix meaning in while Exo is a prefix meaning out There are three main endogenous processes fold folding faulting and volcanism They take place mainly along the Tectonic plate plate boundaries which are the zones that lay on the edges of plates These zones are weak Endogenous processes cause many major landform features Many exogenous forces are as a result of other bodies in Outer space space For example the Moon causes tide s in the Earth s oceans and other big bodies of water Impacts from comet s and meteoroid s change the surface of the Earth When they strike the Earth they create crater s which are holes which can be very big or small in the ground Radiation from the Sun can cause aurora e which are lights that can be seen at night near the Geographical pole poles An example of an exogenous process that is not as a result of bodies in space is erosion Erosion happens as a result of wind water ice or people animals or plants digging in the Earth Some other examples of exogenous process are rainfall snowfall hailstorm erosion tsunamis avalanches winds wave currents etc
