A refrigerant is a chemical that is found in an air conditioner a refrigerator and in other refrigeration equipment Refrigerants can be a liquid or a vapor depending on their temperature and pressure Most refrigerants in their liquid state will evaporate very fast if at atmospheric pressure but this depends on the particular refrigerant and its particular boiling point Refrigerants in their vapor state are compressed by a compressor then cooled by a condenser where it condenses back into a liquid The refrigerant is very hot as it leaves the compressor The refrigerant then passes through a part called a metering device or an expansion device where the pressure is reduced to a point where the liquid begins to boil At this point the refrigerant is very cold and it enters an evaporator where it absorbs heat from the air passing over it By the time the refrigerant leaves the evaporator it is all a vapor again and it goes back to the compressor where the cycle begins again This is called the refrigeration cycle This is one example of the use of a refrigerant as in a residential air conditioning system
