 Uranium lead is one of the oldest and most refined of the radiometric dating schemes It can be used over an age range of about million years to over billion years Accuracy and precision Precision is in the percent range The method relies on two separate decay chain s the uranium series from The existence of two parallel uranium lead decay routes allows several dating techniques within the overall U Pb system The term U Pb dating normally implies the coupled use of both decay schemes However use of a single decay scheme leads to the U Pb isochron dating method analogous to the rubidium strontium dating method Finally ages can also be determined from the U Pb system by analysis of Pb isotope ratios alone This is termed the lead lead dating method Clair Cameron Patterson an American geochemist who pioneered studies of uranium lead radiometric dating methods is famous for having used it to obtain one of the earliest accurate estimates of the age of the Earth
