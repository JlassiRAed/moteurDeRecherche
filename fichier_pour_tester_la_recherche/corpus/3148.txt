 ASIC or Application specific integrated circuit is a kind of integrated circuit It is built for a particular use instead of for general purpose use Digital circuit s are a common form of ASIC but analog ASICs were manufactured beginning in the latter half of the s ASIC has advantages compared to Programmable Logic Device or Standard Logic IC ASIC has a miniaturized embodiment size ASIC can improve speed ASIC needs less electric power to operate There are also disadvantages of ASIC the cost per a unit can be high when producing a small number of units because of the cost in producing a Photomask they can be hard to design and it is expensive and wastes time if they need to be redesigned the time of a manufacturing process can be long
