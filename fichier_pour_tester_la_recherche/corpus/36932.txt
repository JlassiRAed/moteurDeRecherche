A flood basalt or trap basalt is the result of a giant volcanic eruption or series of eruptions that coats large stretches of land or the ocean floor with basalt lava Flood basalts have covered areas as large as a continent in prehistory creating great plateau s and mountain range s Flood basalts have erupted at various times throughout Earth history They are clear evidence that the Earth has periods of higher activity rather than being in a uniform steady state Mahoney J J Coffin M F Large igneous provinces continental oceanic and planetary flood volcanism Geophysical Monograph Washington DC American Geophysical Union One explanation for flood basalts is that they are caused by the combination of Rift continental rifting and its associated melting Then a mantle plume produces vast quantities of a basalt ic magma These have a low viscosity which is why they flood rather than form taller volcano es Flood basalts start at between and km depth in the asthenosphere To get a partial melting as large as that of the traps expelling huge quantities of lava it is necessary to have a large heat input Such melting can take place near a Hotspot hotspot resulting in a mixture of magma from the depths of the hotspot with superficial magma produced by a mantle plume
