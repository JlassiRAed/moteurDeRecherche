 The W M Keck Observatory is a pair of two large ground based telescope s located at Mauna Kea Hawaii Sitting more than two miles above sea level the paired telescopes are used to examine light from distant stars in great detail The primary mirrors of each of the two telescopes are meters across making them slightly smaller than the Gran Telescopio Canarias primary mirrors However all of the light collected by the Keck Observatory primary mirrors is sent to the secondary mirror and the instruments compared to GTC s primary mirror which has an effective light collection area of m or square feet less than each of the Keck Observatory primary mirrors Because of this fundamental difference in design Keck Observatory s telescopes arguably remain the largest steerable optical infrared telescopes on Earth
