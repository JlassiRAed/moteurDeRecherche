 Tidal locking is when one side of an astronomical body always face another It is also called synchronous rotation The classic example is the Moon the same side of the Moon always faces the Earth A tidally locked body takes just as long to rotate around its own axis as it does to revolve around its partner This makes one hemisphere constantly face the partner body Usually at any given time only the satellite is tidally locked around the larger body If the two bodies are similar in mass and their distance apart is small the tidal force will lock each to the other This is the case between Pluto and Charon Charon If the Moon were not spinning at all it would alternately show its near and far sides to Earth while moving around Earth in orbit It is possible to work out how long it takes for a particular case of tidal locking to occur It is just a rough estimate because some factors are poorly known An example is the wikt rigid rigidity of a planetary body and its change in shape under tidal force Tidal locking is an aspect of orbital resonance
