 Creatine is a combination of three non essential amino acids methionine arginine and glycine Creatine is used for the production of adenosine triphosphate which is the human body s energy Creatine is already in the body as a natural substance The body changes it to phosphocreatine It is then stored as energy in the muscles The energy systems of the body are aerobic lactate and phosphocreatine Creatine is mainly used in the lactate system and the phosphocreatine system because these two need more energy They also take a part of the energy from the production or the absorption of creatine
