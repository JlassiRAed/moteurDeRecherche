 Linear A is an ancient writing system script used on Crete No one has been able to translate this script yet It was one of the writing systems used in Minoan civilization Minoan Crete Another script about a century older is called Cretan hieroglyphs For some time both methods of writing were used Probably each system was used for a special purpose Linear A was used from about the th century BC until the th century BC Linear B is a script based on Linear A It has been translated Archaeology Archaeologist Arthur Evans found both Linear A and B Linear A has about fifty signs that are similar to those in Linear B About of the signs in Linear A are unique Using the knowledge from Linear B to read Linear A produces text which cannot be read The language used has been called Eteocretan It does not seem to be related to any known language Today about characters are known The meaning of about ideogram ideographic characters is known These are combined with the syllables Also there are a few numeral s whose value is known Most texts seem to be lists A few are probably short dedication s as they are found on libation s So far no long texts have been found Straight lines such as those used for Linear A are not very practical to use on clay tables For this reasons most writing was probably done on other things such as papyrus or parchment The problem with these materials is that they do not last as long as clay does For this reason most writing on papyrus and parchment has probably been lost
