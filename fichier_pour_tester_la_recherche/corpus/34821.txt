 Stalagmites may also refer to a type of fungus A stalagmite from the Greek language Greek stalagma deposits of calcium carbonate form columns on the ground The corresponding formation on the ceiling of a cave is known as a stalactite There are several methods to help remember which formation hangs from the ceiling When touring caves with stalactites and stalagmites you might be asked to not touch the rock formations This is generally because the formation is considered to still be growing and forming Since the rock buildup is formed by minerals solidifying out of the water solution skin oils can disturb where the mineral water will cling So the development of the rock formation will be affected and not natural anymore Stalactites and stalagmites can also form on concrete ceilings and floors but they form much more rapidly there than in the natural cave environment
