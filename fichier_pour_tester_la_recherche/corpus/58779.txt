 Tetrapods are vertebrate land animal s The basic tetrapod plan is four legs and foot feet This kind of locomotion is quadrupedal Amphibian s reptile s dinosaur s bird s and mammal s are all tetrapods Even though snake s do not have limbs they are tetrapods because they evolution evolved from animals with four limbs The earliest tetrapods evolved from the Sarcopterygii or lobe finned fish into air breathing amphibians perhaps in the Upper Devonian period This means the transition took place in fish before the land was the main habitat This is typical of transitional fossil s undergoing mosaic evolution
