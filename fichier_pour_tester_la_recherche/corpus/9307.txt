 Fluid statics is the science of fluid s at rest and is a sub field within fluid mechanics The term usually refers to the mathematical treatment of the subject It embraces the study of the conditions under which fluids are at rest in stability stable hydrostatic equilibrium equilibrium The use of fluid to do work is called hydraulics and the science of fluids in motion is fluid dynamics hydrostatic pressure is pressure that a fluid exerts when pushing against the sides of a vessel
