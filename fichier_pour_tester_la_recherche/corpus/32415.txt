The Lorenz attractor is a system of equations Edward N Lorenz formulated the equation equations as a simplified mathematical model for atmospheric convection The equations are ordinary differential equation s called Lorenz equations They are notable for having Chaos theory chaotic solutions for certain parameter values and starting conditions In particular the Lorenz attractor is a set of chaotic solutions of the Lorenz system which when plotted resemble a butterfly or figure eight The notion of butterfly effect is coupled with that of the Lorenz attractor Lorenz first used the phrase in a speech he gave in
