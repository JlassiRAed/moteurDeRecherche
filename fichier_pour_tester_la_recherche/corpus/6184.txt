A Plasma window is a field of Plasma planes inside a cylinder As plasma increases in temperature it becomes thicker At a high enough temperature plasma is thick enough to separate a vacuum from normal atmosphere Plasma does not stop radiation for example laser s from moving through it Because of this scientist s can use a plasma window to create an area of vacuum while still letting radiation to move through it This is needed because certain types of radiation can only be created in a vacuum but scientists need to use the radiation on things that are found in a normal atmosphere
