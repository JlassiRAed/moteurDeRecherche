The magnetic moment of a magnet is a quantity that determines the Force force that the magnet can exert on electric currents and the torque that a magnetic field will exert on it A loop of electric current a bar magnet an electron a molecule and a planet all have magnetic moments Both the magnetic moment and magnetic field may be considered to be vector s having a magnitude and direction The direction of the magnetic moment points from the south to north pole of a magnet The magnetic field produced by a magnet is proportional to its magnetic moment as well More precisely the term magnetic moment normally refers to a system s magnetic dipole moment which produces the first term in the multipole expansion of a general magnetic field The dipole component of an object s magnetic field is symmetric about the direction of its magnetic dipole moment and decreases as the inverse cube of the distance from the object
