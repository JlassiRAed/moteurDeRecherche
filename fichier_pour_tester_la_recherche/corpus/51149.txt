In physics interference is the effect of wave Two waves always interfere even if the result of the addition is complicated or not remarkable Something that happens when two or more waves are in the same space Sometimes the peak of one wave joins with the peak of another wave so the resulting peak is twice as high Sometimes the peak of one wave falls into the trough of another wave and the surface is then flat When waves add their effects it is called positive interference or constructive interference When one wave subtracts from the effects of the other it is called negative interference or destructive interference If two people pushed on a car in the same direction they would move the car better than either one alone That would be positive interference If two people of equal strength pushed the car from opposite directions then it would not be moved by either of them That would be negative interference
