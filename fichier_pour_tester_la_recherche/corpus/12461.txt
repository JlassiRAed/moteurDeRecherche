 Gene expression is the process by which the heritable information in a gene the sequence of DNA base pairs is made into a functional gene Product cell or organism Several steps in the gene expression process may be modulated This includes both the transcription and translation stages and the final folded state of a protein Gene regulation switches genes on and off and so controls cell differentiation and morphogenesis Gene regulation may also serve as a basis for evolutionary change control of the timing location and amount of gene expression can have a profound effect on the development of the organism The expression of a gene may vary a lot in different tissues This is called pleiotropism a widespread phenomenon in genetics
