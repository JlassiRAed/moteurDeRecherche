 Corrosion is the breakdown of material s due to Chemical reaction reactions It is usually oxidation with air molecule s and often in the presence of water Corrosion also occurs when an acid ic or basic material touches another material When a material corrodes it changes and becomes weaker Materials that corrode include metal plastic and wood Also corrosion is a form of erosion One form of high temperature corrosion can lead to the formation of compacted oxide layer glaze s which under certain circumstances reduces wear Iron corrosion is called rust ing
