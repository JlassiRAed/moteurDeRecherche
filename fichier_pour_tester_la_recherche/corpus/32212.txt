 Calycanthaceae Gomortegaceae Hernandiaceae Lauraceae Monimiaceae Siparunaceae The Laurales are an order order of flowering plant s They are a basal group of dicot s They are related to and sometimes included in the Magnoliales The order includes genera from seven family and the spice bush or Calycanthus of the Calycanthaceae The earliest lauraceous fossil s are from the Cretaceous It is possible that the ancient origin of this order is one of the reasons for its highly diverged morphology Indeed at present no one trait is known which would unify all the members of Laurales This used to cause much argument among botanists about the correct limits of the order The presently classification is based on recent molecular biology molecular and genetic analysis
