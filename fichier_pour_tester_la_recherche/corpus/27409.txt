 Embolomeri Chroniosuchia Gephyrostegida Diadectomorpha Amniota crown group Reptiliomorpha is a clade of the amniotes and those tetrapods that share a more recent common ancestor with amniotes than with living amphibians Unfortunately different experts have used the term in several different ways It has even been used for fossils of early amphibians It is best used for animals which lay cleidoic egg s but are not synapsids Otherwise precursors of reptiles Its only justification is that it may not always be possible to decide which group a fossil is from But gradually as with Seymouria it is possible to separate fossils into more specific grouups
