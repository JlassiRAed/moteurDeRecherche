A supreme court is generally the highest court in a country This means that in many countries it is the court of last resort and it has more power than other courts Decisions of lower appellate court s can be overruled here However not all highest courts are named as such Civil law countries do not tend to have only one high court Additionally the highest court in some jurisdictions is not named the Supreme Court For example the High Court of Australia In some places the court named the Supreme Court is not the highest court Examples include the New York Supreme Court the Supreme Courts of several provinces and territories of Canada and the former Supreme Court of Judicature of England and Wales Decisions made in these courts are all subject to higher Courts of Appeal
