 Allele frequency refers to the different forms of a gene at a single position on a chromosome It is the proportion of a given allele to all alleles at the same locus It is usually expressed as a percentage Allele frequencies may be used to describe genetics genetic diversity in a population If the frequency of any allele is above it is probable that natural selection is maintaining it at this level This is because the natural mutation rate of an allele is almost always much lower than A fixed allele is one allele that exists for a particular population A fixed allele is homozygous for all members of the population The term allele refers to one variant gene out of several possible for a particular locus in the DNA When all but one allele go away one only remains That allele is said to be fixed
