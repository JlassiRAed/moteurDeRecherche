A cell wall is the wall of a cell in plant s bacteria fungi algae and some archaea Animal cells do not have cell walls nor do protozoa Cell walls protect the cells from damage It is also there to make the cell strong to keep its shape and to control the growing of the cell and plant The cell wall is the tough usually wikt flexibility flexible but sometimes fairly rigid layer that surrounds some types of cells It is outside the cell membrane and gives these cells support and protection as well as acting as a filter The cell wall also acts as a pressure vessel preventing over expansion when water enters the cell by osmosis The material in the cell wall varies In plants and algae the cell wall is made of long molecule s of cellulose pectin and hemicellulose The cell wall has channels which let some protein s in and keeps others out Water and small molecules can go through the cell wall and the cell membrane
