 Dilation and evacuation A dilation and evacuation involves two major steps First the cervix can be put into the cervix The second step of the D E procedure is to evacuate or remove everything inside of the uterus The woman is given a local anesthetic to numb part of her body or a general anesthetic to put her to sleep The doctor will then put a cannula out everything that is in the uterus including the fetus The doctor may use forceps to take out any tissue that is still in the uterus The doctor may also use a curette to scrape out the lining of the uterus The vacuum can then be used again to make sure that the uterus is completely empty This is to prevent infection from tissue left behind by accident If a woman is earlier on in her pregnancy this procedure can sometimes be done without dilating the cervix first This is called a vacuum aspiration It can be used for women who are in the first trimester or for women who are in the early stages of the second trimester However sometime during the second trimester it becomes very difficult to do this procedure without dilating the cervix first At this point a full dilation and extraction is needed A complete D E usually takes to minutes Most abortions are done much earlier on in the pregnancy so a full dilation and extraction is usually not needed
