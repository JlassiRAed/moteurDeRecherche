 Mid s Neutrinos are a type of elementary particle that exist all across the universe Physicists study these particles but they are hard to find because they have a very small chance of interacting with matter regular matter Neutrinos travel near the speed of light Cho Adrian Once Again Physicists Debunk Faster Than Light Neutrinos Science AAAS We used to think that they have no mass but a few years ago physicists found that they have a very small mass much lighter than electrons By finding neutrinos we can learn about the structure and the history of the universe Neutrinos are very difficult to detect They are very unlikely to collide This means that they are unaffected by the electromagnetic force too Detectors built to find them only see a year They are commonly generated in particle accelerator s the sun Radioactive decay nuclear reactions and other stars They are generated whenever there is a Radioactive decay nuclear reaction in the form of Beta decay This process starts off with one neutron and ends with one electron one proton and one neutrino The types of neutrinos are named after the previous three lepton s There is the electron Electron neutrino neutrino Each neutrino has an antiparticle called an antineutrino Therefore there is an electron antineutrino a muon antineutrino and tau antineutrino The three types of neutrinos change into each other over time so an electron neutrino could turn into a tau neutrino and then back again This is called neutrino oscillation This was first suggested as there were only a third of the number of electron neutrinos coming from the sun as theories of the time said there should be Most neutrinos passing through the Earth come from the Sun About billion solar neutrino s per second pass through every square centimeter perpendicular to the direction of the Sun in the region of the Earth cite journal
