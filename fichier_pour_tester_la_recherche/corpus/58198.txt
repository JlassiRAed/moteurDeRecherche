 Ordinal numbers sets Suppose a person has four different T shirt s and then lays them in front of the person from left to right If the person then starts counting the shirts from the left he would first see the red shirt So the red shirt is the first T shirt The blue shirt is the second T shirt The yellow shirt is the third one and the orange T shirt is the fourth one The first second third and fourth in this case are ordinal numbers They result from the fact that the person has many objects and they give them an order The person then simply counts those objects and gives the ordinal numbers to them
