A compiler is a computer program that translation translates instruction text into a different language of instruction text The first language is called the source language which is why instruction text is called source code The second language called the target is usually for the computer to follow In that case the instructions become machine code If a compiler can convert the same instruction text into machine code for different computers it is a cross compiler If the compiler can make instruction text that is easier for people to read it is a de compiler People who write these instructions are called programmers Some even made programs that can translate the instructions that describe how a compiler should work into a compiler That kind of program is called a compiler compiler A compiler usually has three steps It reads the text and makes notes about how the words and sentences go together If the words don t make sense it will try to tell the programmer Then it will use what it knows about the target language to make the instructions fit better It then writes down the instructions in the target language If the source instructions are on different pages it may have to compile several before it can write everything down
