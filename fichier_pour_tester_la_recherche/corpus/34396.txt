The geoid is a shape like the surface of the Earth It is a D geometry geometrical shape like an orange Shapes of this kind are called oblate spheroid s which is a kind of ellipsoid The geoid however is a very special kind of oblate spheroid It is definition defined as follows The geoid is the shape that the surface of the oceans would take under the influence of Earth s gravitation and rotation alone in the absence of other influences such as winds and tides It was defined by Carl Friedrich Gauss Gauss nearly two hundred years ago The study of Earth s measurements and shapes is called geodesy For many practical purposes a simpler shape is used because that makes calculations easier That shape is called a ellipsoid reference ellipsoid In basic education the shape of the Earth is described as being like an orange a sphere but wider round the equator This shape is produced by all celestial spinning spheres such as stars and planets The details differ somewhat in each individual case
