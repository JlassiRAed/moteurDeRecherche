 Nucleic acids are macromolecule large molecules where genetic information is stored There are two types of nucleic acids DNA deoxyribonucleic acid better known as DNA and ribonucleic acid better known as RNA The nucleic acids are made of nucleotide s A nucleotide is made of a nitrogenous base monosaccharide sugar with five carbon atoms and a phosphateNucleic acids allow organisms to transfer genetic information from one generation to the next When a cell divides its DNA is copied and passed from one cell generation to the next generation DNA is organized into chromosomes and found within the nucleus of our cells Its function in any cell is to carry the sequence of bases which will be transcription translated into proteins mainly enzymes But there are other types of RNA and these are called non coding RNA s
