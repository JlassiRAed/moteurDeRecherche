A triode is a type of vacuum tube It differs from a vacuum tube diode which has only two electrode s by having a third electrode called the grid between the cathode and anode When the cathode is heated it gives out electron s These electrons are then absorbed by the anode This process makes an electric current which is controlled by the grid The addition of the grid allows the triode to be used as an amplifier Lee De Forest invented this device in from his original two electrode Audion of The triode incorporates the key principle of amplification The name triode emerged because people needed to distinguish it from other similar vacuum tubes Not only can the triode perform amplification it can also work as part of an oscillator and detecting waves It is used in radios however since the s the transistor has mostly replaced it It is an ancestor of the transistor It is still used in vacuum tube amplifiers
