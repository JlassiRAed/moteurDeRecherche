 Mesons are incredibly small subatomic particle s that are made of one quark and one Antimatter antiquark Antiquarks are the antimatter counterpart of a regular quark meaning that in a fraction of a second a quark and its antiquark will destroy each other to produce only energy Since antimatter quarks have the opposite Spin spin of regular quarks their spins can cancel each other out which forms a particle similar to a Higgs Boson The name meson comes from Greek mesos meaning middle This is because the mass es of the first mesons discovered were between the mass of light particles like electron s called lepton s and heavy particles like proton s called baryon s
