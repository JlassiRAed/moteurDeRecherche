This is an astronomical template that adds a link to an astronomical object at WikiSky The template finds out what to link from the page s name The template does not work for moving objects in the Solar System such as planets comets asteroids etc July Now links WikiSky s object data image page For some objects this doesn t work well e g the Messier galaxies need the NGC numbers as a parameter This is a bug in WikiSky that has been reported and is being fixed
