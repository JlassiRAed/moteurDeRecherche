 Chemical species are atom s molecule s molecular wikt fragment fragment s ion s etc being subjected to a chemical process or to a measurement Generally a chemical species can be defined as an ensemble of chemically identical molecular entity molecular entities that can wikt explore explore the same set of molecular energy level s on a defined time scale Chemists also use chemical species to mean a set of chemically identical atomic or molecular structural units in a solid array For example when molecules of NaCl dissolve in water we don t really have any NaCl as such in the solution We have NaIn supramolecular chemistry chemical species are those supramolecular structures whose interactions and associations are brought about by forming or breaking intermolecular chemical bond bond s Studying these actions is the main topic of supramolecular chemistry
