A cutscene is a time in a video game where the game stops and the player watches something happen Usually cutscenes tell part of the story such as showing characters talking or having a narrator say what is going on Sometimes however a cutscene just shows something that is happening in the game like a Boss boss showing up a ship taking off or a building falling down There are many different types of cutscene Some cutscenes are very simple and just show pictures with text like a slideshow Others may be animated like a cartoon Sometimes the cutscene appears directly in the game engine Many new games use Pre rendering prerendered scenes meaning that the scene was created when the game was made and saved as a video file Prerendered videos are sometimes just saved movies of things recorded in the game engine but some use Computer generated imagery which is separately made D graphics which are usually fancier than the game s normal graphics Prerendered scenes with CGI are often used for a game s intro video A few games use live action video footage which is filmed like a movie or television show Sometimes live action footage will be used together with CGI
