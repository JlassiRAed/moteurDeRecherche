 cables This is enough to support data transfer rates of up to MBit s Fibrechannel permits connecting the same disk subsystem to several computers Basically there are two topologies Arbitrated Loop All the devices are connected in a logical bus topology The devices can be connected in a ring much like Token Ring This avoids using the Fibre Channel Switch es which are very expensive Fabric All devices are connected to Fibre Channel Switches This is similar to Ethernet It is more expensive though because Switches that support Fibre Channel are very expensive
