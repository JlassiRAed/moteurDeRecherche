A rearrangement reaction are organic reaction s where the carbon wikt skeleton skeleton of a molecule is rearranged The result is a structural isomer of the original molecule Often a substituent moves from one atom to another atom in the same molecule In the example below the substituent R moves from carbon atom to carbon atom Intermolecular rearrangements also take place Sometimes chemists draw diagram s with arrow s that show how electron s are transferred between chemical bond bonds during a rearrangement reaction Many organic chemistry text books have such diagrams But they do not tell the full story of the reaction mechanism The actual mechanism of a rearrangement with an alkyl group moving is for the group to slide smoothly along a bond not ionic bond breaking and forming One example of this is the Wagner Meerwein rearrangement In pericyclic reaction s the molecular orbital orbital interactions are important The reactions can not be explained by a series of simple discrete electron transfers But the curved arrow s showing a sequence of discrete electron transfer s can give the same result as a rearrangement reaction Yet the diagrams are not necessarily realistic In allylic rearrangement the reaction is ionic Three important rearrangement reactions are rearrangement s pericyclic reaction s and olefin metathesis
