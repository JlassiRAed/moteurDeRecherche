The main sequence is a region on a Hertzsprung Russell Diagram where most star s appear Any star that is plotted within that area is a main sequence star The Sun is a main sequence star Most of the stars in the Milky Way galaxy and most other galaxies are also main sequence stars Hertzsprung Russell diagrams are graph s that measure each star s brightness against its temperature or color The main sequence appears as a band going from the upper left You can see an example of the band of main sequence stars to the right Stars are created from nebula and first appear on the main sequence They stay on the main sequence for millions or billions of years When a star begins to run out of fuel it gets much bigger and colder and turns into a red giant After this happens the star is no longer on the main sequence In general the hottest and brightest stars also have the most mass The main sequence is sometimes divided into two parts Any star that has a mass greater than times the Sun s mass is grouped into the upper main sequence any star with a mass lower than solar masses belongs to the lower main sequence Stars get the energy they produce through nuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium The upper main sequence with higher atomic number s as nuclear catalyst s Because of these different types of fusion stars on the lower main sequence last much longer than stars on the upper main sequence Our Sun is located on the lower main sequence and is predicted to last between and billion years A star located on the upper main sequence may only last a few million years Nowadays a new star may be classified as main sequence just by its color A main sequence star of a particular color has a narrow band of brightness when seen from a standard distance An astronomer could calculate the distance to this newly discovered star by comparing its brightness as seen from Earth against the brightness for a certain color on the main sequence
