 Joule s laws are two first about heat produced by an electric current and second about how the energy of a gas relates to pressure volume and temperature Joule s first law shows the relation between heat generated by an electric current flowing through a conductor conductor It is named after James Prescott Joule and shown as Where Q is the amount of heat I is the electric current flowing through a conductor R is the amount of electric resistance present in the conductor and t is the amount of time that this happens for Joule s second law says that the internal energy of an ideal gas does not change if volume and pressure change but does change if temperature changes
