 Gender performativity is a term first used by the feminist philosopher Judith Butler in her book Gender Trouble She argues that people being born male of female does not make people behave in certain ways She says that people learn to behave in particular ways to fit in to society The idea of gender is just an act or performance This act is the way a persons walks talks dresses and behaves She calls this acting gender performativity So what society regards as conventional gender is just a performances made to please social expectations and not true expressions of a persons gender identity
