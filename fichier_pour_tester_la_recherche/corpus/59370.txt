This ship infobox supports a very large number of fields including some specialty fields that will rarely be used Some fields simply don t make sense in some cases Some different sets of code have been prepared using only the most common fields Select the most appropriate set below and copy and paste the entire code to the top of a ship article then fill in as many fields as possible Empty fields should generally be kept so that a future editor can fill them in unless they make no sense for the ship in question The Full code contains every field the template supports If you want you can copy one of the simplified sets of code and add a few fields from the Full code If you have ideas for improvements or would like to add brand new fields to these templates please post on Template talk Infobox ship begin doc to discuss the changes and how they should be implemented
