The Diffie Hellman key exchange is a way for people to secretly share information When two people want to use cryptography they often only have an insecure channel to exchange information Martin Hellman Whitfield Diffie and Ralph Merkle developed a protocol that allows this information exchange over an insecure channel The resulting protocol has become known as Diffie Hellman key exchange Sometimes it is called Diffie Hellman key agreement Diffie Hellman key establishment Diffie Hellman key negotiation or Exponential key exchange Using this protocol both parties agree on a secret key They use this key to encryption encrypt their communication using a symmetric key algorithm symmetric key cipher The scheme was first published by Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman in Diffie Hellman key agreement itself is an anonymous key agreement protocol it provides the basis for a variety of authenticated protocols and is used to provide perfect forward secrecy in Secure Sockets Layer Transport Layer Security s short lived modes In the original description papers the Diffie Hellman exchange by itself does not provide authentication of the communicating parties and is thus susceptible to a man in the middle attack An attacking person in the middle may establish two different Diffie Hellman key exchanges with the two members of the party A and B appearing as A to B and vice versa allowing the attacker to decrypt then re encrypt the messages passed between them A method to authentication authenticate the communicating parties to each other is generally needed to prevent this type of attack Many Cryptosystem cryptographic authentication solution s include a Diffie Hellman exchange When two parties A and B have a public key infrastructure they may digitally sign the agreed key G or G as in MQV Station to Station protocol STS and the Internet Key Exchange IKE component of the IPsec protocol suite for securing Internet Protocol communications When A and B share a password they may use a password authenticated key agreement form of Diffie Hellman
