 Nuclear DNA is the DNA inside the cell nucleus of eukaryotic cell s This DNA is a double helix with two strands wound around each other This double helix structure was first described by Francis Crick and James D Watson in This DNA is different from the DNA in bacteria mitochondria and plastids such as chloroplast s Nuclear DNA is very long and is bound up in chromosomes which apart from the DNA are protein structures The second difference is that each eukaryote cell has two sets of DNA one set from each parent it is diploid Mitochondrial and plastid DNA is relatively short is in a circle and there is only one set The consequence of nuclear DNA being double is highly important The genes in mitochondria and plastids only change when a mutation happens Nuclear DNA gets shuffled by the cell division known as meiosis part of sexual reproduction This leads to a variety of offspring from any two parents Another feature of nuclear DNA is that it is gene regulation regulated by proteins and RNA systems which control the rate of transcription transcription into messenger RNA In this way most of the cell products are adjusted according to the circumstances
