An orphaned page or image has few or no links to it from other pages If you think an article is orphaned add to the top of it However because Simple Wikipedia does not have many articles a large number of them will be orphaned Because of this editors are generally encouraged not to tag an article unless it has no incoming links at all from other articles In other words as long as there is one other article which links to it the article should not be tagged as orphaned
