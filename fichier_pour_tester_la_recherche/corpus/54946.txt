A river is a stream of water that flows through a channel in the surface of the ground The passage where the river flows is called the river bed and the earth on each side is called a river bank A river begins on high ground or in hills or mountains and flows down from the high ground to the lower ground because of gravity A river begins as a small stream and gets bigger the farther it flows The water in a river is called fresh water It comes from rain or snow and it can usually be drunk safely unless it has been pollution polluted The water in a sea cannot be drunk safely because it is salt water Both people and animals often live near rivers They need water to survive and for humans rivers were once the only means of fast transport
