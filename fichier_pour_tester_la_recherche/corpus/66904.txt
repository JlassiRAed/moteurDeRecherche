 A server is also a person who serves like a waiter at a restaurant or in a hotel In net jargon a server is a computer that serves many things to wikt user user or client machines Usually a server will only do a few things Every type of thing a server does is called a service Services are used by other computers that are called clients The relationship between the client and the server is called a client server relationship For example Wikipedia has a web server which has a service for sending web pages over the Internet Your client computer talks to the Wikipedia s web page service to get web pages for you A server can also host internet games and allow file sharing In simple words the individual computers are connected to some powerful computers called servers These store files and information in the form of website These files can be accessed by different users anywhere from the world using an internet connection So that servers and clients can talk to each other they need to be connected to a computer network network and they need to use the same protocol In networks a protocol is a set way for machines to talk to other machines It is just like a language For example the Wikipedia server runs the HTTP to send web site s to your computer and your computer uses the HTTP Protocol to ask Wikipedia for pages Usually servers are specially made to be more powerful and reliable and they are much more expensive than normal computers Sometimes servers can be clustered which means that lots of servers work together to do one service The server might slow down if there are too many people accessing the server at the same time resulting in a high load It might also be unable to take the high load so it will automatically shut down In a peer to peer system every computer is both a client and a server to each other This is commonly put into file sharing and VOIP However this can help in attempts at copyright infringement piracy Many game servers use a large server for players to store their gaming data and can access them anytime with an internet connection Typical server operating systems are Linux FreeBSD NetBSD and OpenBSD Unlike other computers a server often has no monitor keyboard or mouse When a server doesn t have to do very much server software can run on a computer that is also doing other things
