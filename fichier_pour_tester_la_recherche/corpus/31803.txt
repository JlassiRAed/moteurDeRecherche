 The Black bread mold Rhizopus is a common type of fungus It grows and Reproduction reproduces the same way that most molds do In asexual reproduction the mold makes spores inside a sporangium When the spores are ready to leave and spread more mold the sporangium breaks open and lets the spores float out In sexual reproduction its hyphae touch the hyphae of another Rhizopus mycelium When they fuse they make round balls called zygospores After some time the zygospore makes another sporangium which then makes spores During this sexual process genetic recombination takes place as with all eukaryote s The spores land on a place where they can turn into a new mold and begin to grow They very quickly start making hyphae small tendrils that look like roots Hyphae are not roots but part of the mycelium The mycelium is the main part of the mold and grows inside the bread Black bread mold grows fast when the temperature is higher than degrees Celsius and lower than Black bread mold is found in all countries of the world It is often found growing on bread and on soft fruit s such as banana s and grape s Because the mold spores are airborne the mold can spread easily
