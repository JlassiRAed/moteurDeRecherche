The thread switching latency is the time needed by the operating system to switch the Central processing unit CPU to run another Thread During the thread switching the CPU must save all of the current thread s execution data to memory and load another thread s execution data from memory Since reading and writing from memory requires some latency we can define the thread switching latency as the amount of time needed to complete this operation There is no virtual memory switching required in a thread switch unlike a process switch
