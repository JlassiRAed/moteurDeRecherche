Systems response differently to inputs of different frequencies Some systems may amplify frequencies of certain range and attenuate the other frequencies The way that the system output is related to the input for different frequencies is called frequency response Frequency response means a graph where can be seen how something changes in different sound frequency It is typically used in loudspeaker s Also audio crossover s way to function can be shown with frequency response
