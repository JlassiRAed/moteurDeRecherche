 Gut flora consists of microorganisms that live in the digestive system of animals It is the largest reservoir of microbe s in the human microbiome The human body consisting of about trillion cell cells carries about ten times as many microorganisms in the intestine s Bacteria make up most of the flora in the colon colon Fungi and protozoa also make up a part of the gut flora but little is known about their activities Research suggests that the relationship between gut flora and humans is not merely commensalism commensal and producing hormone s to direct the host to store fats However in some conditions some species can cause disease by producing an infection or increasing cancer risk for the host Over of the bacteria in the gut are anaerobic The traditional view is that no metazoa n phylum can break down cellulose by producing the enzyme cellulase Instead herbivores contain in their gut microorganisms which produce cellulase
