 Virus classification is the way virus es are put into groups by scientists There are many different kinds of viruses Scientists classify viruses to make it easier to learn about them Classification also helps scientists to remember viruses and the diseases they cause The International Committee of Taxonomy of Viruses is in charge of virus classification Sometimes different viruses have things in common This is used in classification For example if they are made from DNA and protein or RNA and protein Other things that are taken into account are the size and shape of the viruses and the diseases they cause Similar viruses are first put into families Each family has a name This family name always ends with viridae For example rotavirus es are in the Reoviridae family and herpes simplex herpes viruses are in the Herpesviridae family Viruses in any one family that are almost the same are then put in a smaller group called a genus Another way of classifying viruses is called the Baltimore Classification This is different from the ICTV one Some scientists prefer the Baltimore Classification because it is based on how viruses grow in cells
