An alternating current magnitude and direction vary unlike direct current whose direction remains constant The usual waveform of an AC power circuit is a sine wave because this leads to the most efficient transmission of energy However in certain applications different waveforms are used such as triangular or square waves When one speaks of alternating current one mostly refers to the form in which electricity is delivered to businesses and residences But Audio frequency audio and Radio frequency radio signals carried on electrical wire are also examples of alternating current In these applications an important goal is often the recovery of information encoded onto the AC signal This means that the direction of current flowing in a circuit is constantly being reversed back and forth This is done with any type of AC voltage source All houses have alternating current The AC comes from a power plant The direction of the electricity switches back times every second This happens so fast that a light bulb does not stop glowing
