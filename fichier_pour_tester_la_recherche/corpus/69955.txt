The Schwarzschild radius or gravitational radius is the radius of a sphere that has certain properties If all the mass of an object is compressed within this sphere the escape velocity escape speed from the surface of the sphere would equal the speed of light An example of an object smaller than its Schwarzschild radius is a black hole Once a compact star stellar remnant collapses below this radius light can no longer escape and the object is no longer visible It is a characteristic radius associated with every quantity of mass The Schwarzschild radius was named after the Germany German astronomer Karl Schwarzschild who calculated this exact solution for the theory of general relativity in
