 Seismic load is one of the basic concepts of earthquake engineering which means application of an earthquake generated agitation or with gravity wave s from tsunami Seismic loading depends primarily on Sometimes seismic load exceeds ability of a structure to resist it without being broken partially or completely Due to their mutual interaction seismic loading and seismic performance of a structure are intimately related
