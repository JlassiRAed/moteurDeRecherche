 Transfection is the process of deliberately introducing DNA or RNA into cells The word is formed from transformation transformation and infection The term is used for transformation Transformation of bacterial cells with viral nucleic acids Transformation of animals cells in tissue culture with purified DNA The DNA is added to the cells genome Transformation of cells or embryo s with single or double stranded RNA This causes the building of particular proteins or the silencing of particular genes Gene therapy using a modified virus as a Vector vector Transfection can result in unexpected morphologies and abnormalities in target cells Transfection with RNA molecules produces changes which cannot be permanently transmitted down a line of cells
