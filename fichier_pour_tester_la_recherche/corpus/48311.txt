 Crystallinity is a physical property of a solid that acts like a crystal The degree of crystallinity of a crystal has a big influence on hardness density Transparency and translucency transparency and diffusion Crystallinity can be measured using x ray diffraction but Calorimeter calorimetric techniques are also commonly used Examples would include sodium chloride sci stub
