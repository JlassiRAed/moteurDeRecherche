Because the pages for years are not updated regularly a method is needed to help provide the best information we have available Most often the births and deaths categories are fairly up to date Because of this the categories usually serve as a better source of information on who was born or died in a specific year These templates are used to include a link on a page to the birth and death categories for specific years They will only show on the pages if the category exists There are versions of both the births and deaths templates Each version has a specific use These are most likely to be used on articles for years which should have a heading for a list of people who were born and died that year These templates should not be substituted All versions of the templates have the same usage The year parameter is only needed if the link needed is to a page other than the one it is one As these templates were designed to be added to specific year pages they default to the page name For example on the page only would be needed to link to the births for the year
