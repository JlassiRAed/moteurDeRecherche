The Entscheidungsproblem is a famous problem of mathematics David Hilbert formulated the problem in Is there an algorithm that will take a formal language and a logical statement in that language and that will output True or False depending on the truth value of the statement The algorithm does not tell how it reaches the answer nor prove it as long as the answer is always correct In and Alonzo Church and Alan Turing showed independently that there can be no answer to the Entscheidungsproblem They showed that it is impossible for an algorithm to decide whether statements in arithmetic are true or false For this reason there can be no solution for the Entscheidungsproblem
