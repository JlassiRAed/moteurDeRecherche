 Gravitational waves are ripples in spacetime which are created whenever objects with mass move They were predicted by Albert Einstein in on the basis of his theory of general relativity B Barish The detection of gravitational waves using LIGO As gravitational waves are not created from stationary objects they must be detected from moving systems Sources of detectable gravitational waves include binary star systems composed of white dwarf s neutron star s or black hole s On February the Advanced LIGO team announced that they had directly detected gravitational waves from a pair of black holes merging
