Most chemical element s are stable If they are not part of a chemical reaction they do not change Chemical elements are made of atom s In stable elements the atom stays the same In a chemical reaction the atoms will form chemical bond s with other atoms Even if the bonds change during a reaction the atoms themselves do not In the th century Henri Becquerel discovered that some chemical elements have atoms that change During their change they send out a particle In Marie Curie Marie and Pierre Curie called this phenomenon radioactive decay Becquerel and the Curies were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for this discovery in
