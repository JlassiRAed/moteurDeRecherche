 OpenGL is a programming interface for D graphics which helps computer programmers make their D graphics perform better and faster by running parts of their programs on a video card Programming interfaces like OpenGL are usually called an API which stands for Application Programming Interface OpenGL is often compared to DirectD an API for D graphics on Windows Programming for DirectD is different in some ways because the APIs use different naming schemes for talking to a computer s graphics driver which means that programmers need to write different code for OpenGL and DirectD to do the same things OpenGL is owned by the Khronos Group and is an example of open source software This means that all of OpenGL s programming and the explanations for how the programming all works can be viewed copied revised and re released by anyone
