An ionic bond is the Chemical bond bonding between a non metal and a metal that occurs when charged atom s attract This happens after a metal atom loses one or more of its electron s to the nonmetal atom This makes the bond stronger and harder to break When this happens the metal becomes a positive cation and the non metal becomes a negative anion This occurs for example when sodium and chlorine join to form common salt NaCl In other buts an ionic bond is the electrostatic force of attraction between two oppositely charged ions The positive ion is called cation and the negative ion is the anion
