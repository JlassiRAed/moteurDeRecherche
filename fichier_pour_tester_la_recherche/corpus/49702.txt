A photodiode is a light sensitive semiconductor It is a type of photodetector capable of changing light into either electric current current or voltage depending upon the wikt mode mode of operation If the anode and cathode leads of a photodiode are joined together by a wire when in the dark no current will flow On the other hand when in the light current flows from the cathode to the anode The diode part of a photodiode allows current to flow in only one wikt direction direction Photodiodes may contain Optics optical filter s built in Lens p
