The Cryogenian is a geology geological period from million years ago to mya It lies in the middle Proterozoic eon before the Ediacaran period The period is important to both Earth science and biology because it contains the two longest and most severe ice age s of all time These two snowball earth events were previously put together as the Varangian glaciation They covered much possible all the Earth with ice The root cause of the temperature drop may have been the removal of CO from the atmosphere by photosynthesis ing bacteria and eukaryote s in the previous periods Much else happened the supercontinent Rodinia broke up and another Pannotia began to form Fossil steroid s suggest the presence of early sponge s and amoeboid cells with tests appear in the fossil record
