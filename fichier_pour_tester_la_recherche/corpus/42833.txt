The Roman Senate was the longest lasting institution in Ancient Rome It began in the first years of the city which was supposedly founded in BC It survived the Roman Kingdom kings the Roman Republic The Senate started as an advisory council of elders The word senate came from senex meaning old man The Senate reached its peak in the middle Republic when it was the most powerful body in Rome The Senate lost much of its power in the first period of the Empire known as the Principate After Diocletian when the centre of government was moved out of Rome the Senate became just a municipal body The influence of the old idea lived on and Constantine II set up a Senate in Constantinople
