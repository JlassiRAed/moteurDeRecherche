The Qur an sometimes spelled Koran This book is different from other religion religious texts in that it is believed to be written directly by God through the prophet Muhammad Some Muslims call it the Final Testament It has been written and read only in Arabic language Arabic for more than years But because many Muslims around the world do not understand Arabic the meaning of the Qur an is also given in other languages so that readers can understand better what the Arabic words in the Qur an mean These books are like dictionary dictionaries to the Qur an they are not read as part of the religion of Islam to replace the Arabic Qur an Muslims believe that these translations are not the true Qur an only the Arabic copy is the true Qur an The Quran is used with the hadith to interpret sharia law
