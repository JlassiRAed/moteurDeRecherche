 Structural engineering is a subset of civil engineering dealing with the design and analysis of building s and large non building structures to withstand both the gravity and wind loads as well as natural disasters Besides it may also cover design of machinery medical equipment vehicles or any other objects where structural functionality or safety are involved Structural engineers must ensure their designs satisfy building code s Major structural engineering projects go through the following four stages research design test ing and construction which are featured with the images below File EPET print out jpgFile Multi Frequency Quieting Building System jpgFile Pearl River Tower jpgStructural engineering came to existence when the humans first started to construct their own structures It became a more defined profession with the emergence of the architecture profession during the industrial revolution in the late th Century Entry level structural engineers may design individual structural elements of a structure for example Beam beams column s and floor s of a building More experienced engineers would be responsible for the structural design and integrity of an entire system such as a building Structural engineers often specialize in particular fields such as bridge engineering building engineering pipeline engineering industrial structures or special mechanical structures such as vehicle s or aircraft s
