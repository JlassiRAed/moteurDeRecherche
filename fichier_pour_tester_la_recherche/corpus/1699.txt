 Ordinary least squares or linear least squares is a method for estimating unknown parameters in statistics It is a method used in linear regression The aim of the method is to minimize the difference between the observed responses and the responses predicted by the linear approximation of the data A smaller difference means that model fits the data better Ordinary least squares is a special case of a method commonly called least squares The resulting estimator can be expressed by a simple formula
