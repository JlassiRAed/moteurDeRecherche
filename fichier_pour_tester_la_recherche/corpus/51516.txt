 Attached Resource Computer NETwork is a communications protocol for local area network s ARCNET was the first widely available Computer network networking system for microcomputer s it became popular in the s for office automation tasks It was later applied to embedded system s where certain features of the protocol are especially useful It was first used in Arcnet uses a star like topology which is much easier to build and maintain than the bus topologies of other protocols developed later such as Ethernet Original arcnet used coaxial cable s and a token passing mechanism much like token ring At about MBit s maximum speed ARCnet is much slower than other network protocols such as ethernet Because of its token passing mechanisms there are no collisions between packets This makes it suitable for certain industrial applications as well as for ohme automation where it is still used
