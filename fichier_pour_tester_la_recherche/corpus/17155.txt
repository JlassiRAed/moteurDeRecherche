In the Physics physical sciences mass and weight are different The mass of an object is a measure of the amount of matter in the object Weight is a measure of the Force force on the object caused by a gravitational field In other words weight is how hard gravity pulls on an object This means the mass of an object will remain at wherever it is on the earth s surface but if it is moved from the equator to the North Pole its weight will grow by because of the increase in the earth s gravitational field Mass is measured in kilogram s or Pound newtons the standard unit for force A one kilogram mass placed on a bench presses down on the bench with almost ten newtons of force
