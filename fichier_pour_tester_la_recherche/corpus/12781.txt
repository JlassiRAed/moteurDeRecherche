A blind spot is a part of the visual field our brains get no information from It is the place in the visual field that corresponds to the lack of light detecting photoreceptor cell s where the optic nerve passes through the optic disc of the retina Since there are no cells to detect light on the optic disc a part of the field of vision is not perceived The human brain brain fills in with surrounding detail with information from the other eye so the blind spot is not normally perceived Although all vertebrate s have this blind spot cephalopod eyes which are superficially similar do not In them the optic nerve approaches the receptors from behind so it does not create a break in the retina The first documented observation of the phenomenon was in the s by Edme Mariotte in France At the time it was generally thought that the point at which the optic nerve entered the eye should actually be the most sensitive portion of the retina however Mariotte s discovery disproved this theory
