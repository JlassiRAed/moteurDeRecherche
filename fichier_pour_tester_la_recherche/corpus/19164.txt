 Spread spectrum is a method in radio and other kinds of telecommunication Its purpose is to overcome interference noise noise and radio jamming jamming of signals Sending electromagnetic signals through the air became possible in the later th century with wireless telegraphy The fact that signals were affected by natural interference was soon discovered By the early s wireless telegraphy could cross the Atlantic Intercepting the enemy s radio communications and interfering with their transmission was important in World War II Messages in code were intercepted and recorded for decryption and translation Not only can radio signals be detected but those listening can be detected since radio receivers also emit a signal Above all since radio direction finding is very widely used in civil and military aviation ways are needed to reduce interference with these transmissions The main method is spread spectrum Spread spectrum systems transmit the message using a bandwidth that is wider than the bandwidth actually needed by the message signal This spreading of the transmitted signal over a large bandwidth make the resulting wideband signal appear as a noise signal This resists intentional and unintentional interference with the transmitted signal Direct sequence spread spectrum transmits the messages over a wide bandwidth It adds chips of noise to the message The sequence of chips produced by the transmitter is already known by the receiver The receiver uses the same pseudonoise sequence to reconstruct the information signal Benefits It resists intended or unintended jamming It shares a single channel among multiple users It reduces the signal background noise level this hampers signals intelligence interception Determines the relative timing between transmitter and receiver Frequency hopping spread spectrum transmits radio signals by rapidly switching a carrier among many frequency channels It uses a pseudo random sequence known to both transmitter and receiver Its benefits are Spread spectrum signals are resist narrowband interference Spread spectrum signals are difficult to intercept A spread spectrum signal may simply look like an increase in the background noise to a narrowband receiver Spread spectrum transmissions can share a frequency band with many types of conventional transmissions with little interference Military users can generate the channel sequence with a transmission security key that the sender and receiver share in advance For such critical uses spread spectrum methods alone do not give enough security
