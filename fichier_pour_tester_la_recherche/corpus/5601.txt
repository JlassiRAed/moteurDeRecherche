 Vulcan was a theory theoretical planet In the th century the planet was thought to orbit close to the sun Its gravity gravitational pull would explain changes seen between the perihelion advance of Mercury was causing similar changes in the orbit of Uranus from the orbit predicted by classical theory None of the searches for Vulcan found a planet This caused some people to not agree with Newtonian theory It led to the development of Special Relativity and General Relativity Albert Einstein s modified theory of gravity showed why the orbit of Mercury changes without the existence of Vulcan This disproved the theories of Vulcan
