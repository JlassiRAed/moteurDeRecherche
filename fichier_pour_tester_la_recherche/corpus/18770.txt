 Napalm is the name for a number of flammable liquid s that have been used in war fare Often it is jellied gasoline Napalm is actually the thickener in such liquids When it is mixed with gasoline the thickener makes a sticky incendiary gel It was developed by the U S in World War II by a team of Harvard chemists The team leader was Louis Fieser The name napalm has comes from the ingredients that were first used to make it coprecipitated aluminium aluminum salts of naphtha na phthenic and palmitic palm itic acids These were added to the flammable substance to cause it to gel One of the major problems of early incendiary fluids was that they splashed and drained too easily The U S found that flamethrowers that use a gasoline gel are able to shoot farther and are more useful Gasoline gel was difficult to manufacture because it used natural rubber which was in high demand and expensive Napalm provided a far cheaper alternative It solved the problems involved with rubber based incendiaries Nowadays napalm is mostly made of benzene and polystyrene and is known as napalm B Napalm was used in flamethrowers and bomb s by the U S and Allies of World War II Allied forces to increase the usefulness of flammable liquids Napalm is made to burn at a specific rate and stick to materials This is done by mixing different of amounts of napalm and other materials Another useful effect primarily involving its use in bombs was that napalm rapidly deoxygenates the available air It also creates large amounts of carbon monoxide causing suffocation Napalm bombs were also used in the Vietnam War to clear landing zone s for helicopters Though napalm was a th century invention it is part of a long history of incendiary materials in warfare However historically it was primarily liquids that were used An infantry based flammable liquid fuel weapon the flamethrower was introduced in World War I by the Germans variations of which were soon developed by other sides in the conflict
