The League of Nations was the predecessor to the United Nations The League was founded in after World War I but failed to maintain peace during World War II The League had a Council of the great power s and an Assembly of all the member countries The League of Nations was thought up by Woodrow Wilson the American President during the First World War It was to be a group of nations that worked together to keep peace One of the reasons for its downfall was that after a vote the American public refused to join The League did not have the power it needed to enforce any of the rules that made it up This later proved to be a fatal flaw in the League s structure Another flaw in the League was that it was not representative enough no more than nations were members at any given time and the interests of the leading members often outweighed those of smaller less powerful members The League also had no troops of its own and decisions it made were often slow For example when the Empire of Japan invaded Manchuria in it took a whole year for the League s decision to be heard After a series of disasters in the s it was abolished It was thought to be weak and powerless after Empire of Japan Japan completely ignored it when the League of Nations tried to stop Japan from invading Manchuria and Italy invaded Abyssinia The League did not fail completely it had prevented a few conflicts in Europe in the s and worked hard to relieve various public health and social problems around the world
