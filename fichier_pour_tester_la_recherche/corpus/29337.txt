 Attack models or attack types specify how much information a Cryptanalysis cryptanalyst has access to when breaking or cracking an Encryption encrypted message commonly known as codebreaking or cracking the code Some common attack models are Ciphertext only attack Known plaintext attack Chosen plaintext attack Chosen ciphertext attack Chosen ciphertext attack Adaptive chosen ciphertext attack Adaptive chosen ciphertext attack Chosen ciphertext attack Lunchtime attacks Indifferent chosen ciphertext attack The ciphertext only attack model is the weakest because it implies that the cryptanalyst has just the encoded message Different attack models are used for other cryptographic systems or more generally for all kind of security systems Examples for such attack models are Digital signature Digital signature security and attacks Adaptive chosen message attack for digital signature s
