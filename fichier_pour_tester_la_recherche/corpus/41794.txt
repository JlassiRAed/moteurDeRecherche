 Genome editing is a type of genetic engineering DNA is inserted replaced or removed from a genome using artificially engineered nuclease s or molecular scissors The nucleases make specific double strand breaks by natural processes At present there are four families of engineered nucleases being used To understand the function of a gene or a protein one interferes with it in a sequence specific way and watches its effects on the organism However in some organisms it is difficult or impossible to do site specific mutation Therefore more indirect methods have to be used Examples are gene silencing Silencing the gene of interest by RNA interference short RNA interference Yet gene disruption by siRNA can be variable and incomplete Genome editing with nucleases such as ZFN This is different from siRNA The engineered nuclease is able to modify DNA binding Therefore it can in principle cut any targeted position in the genome and introduce change the sequences for genes which cannot be specifically targeted by conventional RNAi Genome editing was chosen by Nature Gallagher James Dawn of gene editing medicine BBC News Health James Scientists get gene editing go ahead BBC News Health
