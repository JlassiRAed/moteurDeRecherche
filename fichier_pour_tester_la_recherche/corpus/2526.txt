In number theory the totient phi For example because the four numbers and are coprime to The function function used here is the totient function usually called the Euler totient or Euler s totient after the Switzerland Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler who studied it The totient function is also called Euler s phi function or simply the phi function since the Greek letter Phi The totient function is important mainly because it gives the size of the multiplicative group Lagrange s theorem provides a proof for Euler s theorem A common use of the totient function is in the RSA RSA algorithm The RSA algorithm is a popular method of encryption used worldwide
