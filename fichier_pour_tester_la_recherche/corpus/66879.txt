The biological species concept gives an explanation of how species form However they cannot breed with other groups In other words the group is reproductively isolated from other groups The words reproductively isolated are the key words of the biological species definition Ernst Mayr According to Ernst Mayr a new species forms when an existing species splits A similar idea had been suggested in the th century by Moritz Wagner Once a species lives in two different areas the geographical isolation makes breeding between the groups reduce or stop Each group develops features which make breeding between them work less well Eventually each group becomes a good biological species because the two species do not reproduce with each other even when they are together This is still considered the most common reason for species splitting and has the technical name of allopatric speciation It is contrasted with sympatric speciation where speciation takes place even though all the members live in the same area
