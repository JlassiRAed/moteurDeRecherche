A map projection is a way of showing the surface of a three dimensional sphere on a flat surface Such projections are necessary to create map s The problem with projections is that they change the surface in some way this is called distorsion Depending on the purpose of the map some distorsions may be acceptable For this reason there are different map projections that serve different purposes Carl Friedrich Gauss showed that is not possible to project the surface of a sphere to a plane without distorting it This theorem is known as Theorema egregium today To understand the projections it is easier to imagine a light source a globe and another geometric object The light source shines a shadow of each point of the globe onto the geometric object At the end the surface of the geometric object is unrolled this yields the map It is possible to tell the projections apart by the type of helper object used Using a plane gives azimuthal projections Using a cone gives conical projections Using a cylinder gives cylindrical ones Cylindrical projections put the sphere into a cylinder and then unroll its surface Examples of these are Equirectangular projection Mercator projection Psedocylindrincal Same as cylindrical but only applies to the main meridian and parallels
