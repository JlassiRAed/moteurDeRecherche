In cryptography truncated differential cryptanalysis is a generalization of differential cryptanalysis an attack model against block cipher s In Lars Knudsen design ed the technique during this period ordinary differential cryptanalysis Analysis analyzes the full difference between two texts the truncated version considers differences that are only determined to some extent It has been applied to SAFER International Data Encryption Algorithm IDEA Skipjack Camellia CRYPTON and the stream cipher Salsa as well
