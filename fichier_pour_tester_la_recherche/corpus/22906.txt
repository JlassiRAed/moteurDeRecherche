When two chemical substance s come in contact with each other through what is called a Phase interface If a substance accumulates within a phase this is called absorption if the same process happens on the interface it is called adsorption In the year James William McBain introduced the word Sorption to describe such a process in the case where it is not easy or meaningful to make a difference between absorption and absorption Examples of where the concept of sorption is important are measuring the pollution of the environment using sorption it is possible to bind pollutant s to small particles in the air Sorption makes these bindings possible In much the same way polluants can be transported over long distances Machine s and processes that use sorption include the absorption refrigerator and solar air conditioning
