 Dynamical systems theory is a field of applied mathematics It tries to describe complex dynamical systems often using differential equations and Recurrence relation difference equations When differential equations are used the theory is called continuous dynamical systems theory When difference equations are used it is called discrete dynamical systems theory The theory looks at the long term behaviour of dynamical systems It also studies solutions to the equations of motion mainly for mechanical systems The study also includes the motion of planets or electronic circuits Part of it focuses on solving Partial differential equation s that occur in biology
