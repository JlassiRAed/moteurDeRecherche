This is a list of dinosaur s whose remains have been recovered from North America North America has a rich dinosaur fossil record with great diversity of dinosaurs This may not mean the dinosaurs were more diverse or abundant it may be because substantial resources have been devoted to the North American fossil record The Middle Jurassic is the only poorly represented time period in North America although several Middle Jurassic wikt locality localities are known from Mexico Footprints eggshells teeth and fragments of bone representing theropods sauropods and ornithopods have been found but none of them are diagnostic to the genus level The Upper Jurassic of North America however is the exact opposite of the Middle Jurassic The Upper Jurassic Morrison Formation is found in several U S states including Colorado Utah Wyoming Montana New Mexico Oklahoma South Dakota and Texas It is notable as being the most fertile single source of dinosaur fossils in the world During the Lower Cretaceous new dinosaurs appeared Sauropods were still present but they were not as diverse as they were in the Jurassic Theropods from the early Cretaceous of North America include dromaeosaur s such as Deinonychus and Utahraptor Acrocanthosaurus and Microvenator Sauropods included Astrodon Pleurocoelus and Sauroposeidon Ornithischians were more diverse than they were in the Jurassic Period Tenontosaurus Hypsilophodon Iguanodon Protohadros and Eolambia are some of the ornithopods that lived then Ankylosaurs replaced their stegosaur cousins in the Cretaceous Ankylosaurs from the early Cretaceous of North America include Sauropelta and Gastonia Therizinosaur s such as Falcarius are also known from the early Cretaceous of North America Finally in the long Upper Cretaceous the greatest abundance and diversity of dinosaurs of all time lived in North America During the early part of the Upper Cretaceous the therizinosaur Nothronychus and the ceratopsian Zuniceratops lived During the Campanian stage an enormous diversity of dinosaurs is known Theropods included the tyrannosaurs Albertosaurus Gorgosaurus Daspletosaurus Appalachiosaurus and Dryptosaurus and the dromaeosaurids Dromaeosaurus Saurornitholestes Atrociraptor and Bambiraptor Ceratopsians such as Pachyrhinosaurus Styracosaurus Centrosaurus Monoclonius Brachyceratops Pentaceratops and Leptoceratops also existed Among hadrosaurs Parasaurolophus Corythosaurus Lambeosaurus Saurolophus and Prosaurolophus existed During the latest Cretaceous the Maastrichtian stage and the troodontid Troodon
