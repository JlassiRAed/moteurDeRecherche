 Discrete mathematics is the study of Mathematics mathematical Mathematical structure structures that are discrete space discrete rather than Continuous function continuous In contrast to real number s that vary smoothly discrete mathematics studies objects such as integer s Graph However there is no exact universally agreed definition of the term discrete mathematics Many times discrete mathematics is described less by what is included than by what is excluded continuously varying quantities and related notions The set of objects studied in discrete mathematics can be finite or infinite The term finite mathematics is sometimes applied to parts of the field of discrete mathematics that deals with finite sets particularly those areas relevant to business Research in discrete mathematics increased in the latter half of the twentieth century partly due to the development of digital computers which operate in discrete steps and store data in discrete bits Concepts and notations from discrete mathematics are useful in studying and describing objects and problems in branches of computer science such as computer algorithms programming language s cryptography automated theorem proving and software development In turn computer implementations are significant in applying ideas from discrete mathematics to real world problems such as in operations research Although the main objects of study in discrete mathematics are discrete objects analytic methods from continuous mathematics are often employed as well
