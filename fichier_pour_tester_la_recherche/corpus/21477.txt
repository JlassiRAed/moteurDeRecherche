 Distributed computing is a word from computer science about using many computer s to solve a big problem One way to solve a big problem is to use a very fast computer called a supercomputer Supercomputers are very expensive and many scientists can not buy them A cheaper way to solve a big problem is to split it into smaller problems when possible These smaller problems can then be solved by different computers which talk to each other over a computer network Because many computers work together this makes them as powerful as a supercomputer One example where distributed computing is used is the Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search
