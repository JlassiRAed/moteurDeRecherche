In general relativity a naked singularity is a gravitational singularity that is viewable from the outside The event horizon is like a bubble which surrounds a black hole Inside the event horizon the pull of the light cannot escape so we are unable to view objects inside the event horizon This includes the event horizon itself Naked singularities do not have an event horizon hence the term naked The existence of naked singularities is a very important topic in physics because it would mean we could actually see Phenomenon phenomena made by black holes that we wouldn t be able to see otherwise In addition naked singularities would pose big problems for general relativity since scientists still haven t figured out a working idea for what happens to space time in and around a black hole Quantum mechanics the main other scientific theory scientists turn to in physics is also unable to explain how space time would behave in such a situation Although the cosmic censorship hypothesis says that naked singularities cannot exist some research says that if loop quantum gravity is correct naked singularities could exist in nature Other calculations and arguments have been made to support this
