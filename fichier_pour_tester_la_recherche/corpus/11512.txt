 Radiography is the name for the use of X rays to see what is happening to parts of the body It is an imaging technology imaging technique which uses electromagnetic radiation other than visible spectrum light usually X ray s To create the image a beam of X rays is produced by an X ray machine and is projected toward the object A certain amount of X ray is absorbed by the object which is dependent on the density and composition of that object The X rays that pass through the object are captured behind the object by a detector The detector gives a superimposed D representation of the object s internal structures
