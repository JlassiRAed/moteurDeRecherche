In music variation is a way of organizing a piece of music by taking a tune and then repeating it in several different ways It is often called theme and variation Many composers wrote pieces which are examples of theme and variation Sometimes the theme is one they made up at other times they took a theme that another composer had already written and then made variations on it There are lots of ways of varying a tune and each variation will change it in a different way A variation may play the tune much faster or much slower it may change the tune by adding extra note
