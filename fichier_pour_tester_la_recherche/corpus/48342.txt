 Glenn Theodore Seaborg was an Americans American Chemistry chemist He was born in Ishpening Michigan Ishpening Michigan He won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry with Edwin M McMillan In he changed several thousand atom s of bismuth into gold at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory His experiment al technique using nuclear physics was able to remove proton s and neutron s from the bismuth atom Seaborg s techique would have cost too much money to make of gold but his work is the closest to the myth ical Philosopher s Stone Seaborg worked at the Manhattan Project during World War II He studied the chemical properties of plutonium as a part of the secret war research He served as Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission and was a professor at the University of California Berkeley Seaborg was the principal or co discoverer of ten elements plutonium americium curium berkelium californium einsteinium fermium mendelevium nobelium and element which was named seaborgium in his honor while he was still living He also developed more than atomic isotopes Early in his career Seaborg was a pioneer in nuclear medicine and developed many isotopes of elements that helped to diagnose and treat diseases For example he studied iodine which is used in the treatment of thyroid disease He developed the actinide concept which placed the actinide series beneath the lanthanide series on the periodic table Seaborg also proposed the placement of super heavy elements in the transactinide and superactinide series
