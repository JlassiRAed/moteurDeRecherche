 The Woolly Flying Squirrel is a squirrel It is the only species of the genus Eupetaurus Until recently scientific knowledge of this rare species was limited to skins collected in the late nineteenth century However recent research has confirmed that it is still extant in Pakistan administered Kashmir It is the longest member of the family Sciuridae and the most massive gliding animal known but observations confirm that despite its size it does glide effectively like other flying squirrels
