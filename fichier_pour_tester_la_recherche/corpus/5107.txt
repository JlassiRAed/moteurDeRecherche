A band gap also called a bandgap or energy gap is an energy range in a solid where no electron states can exist The term is used in solid state physics and chemistry Band gaps can be found in Electrical insulation insulator s and semiconductor s In graphs of the electronic band structure of solids the band gap is the energy difference insulator s those with smaller band gaps are semiconductor s Electrical conductor Conductors either have very small band gaps or no band gap if the energy levels of valence and conduction bands overlap
