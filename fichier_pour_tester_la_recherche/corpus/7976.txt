 Native Command Queuing technology actually slows down HD access in certain applications like games and sequential reads and writes because of the added latency induced by NCQ logic fixNative Command Queuing was preceded by Parallel ATA s version of Tagged Command Queuing ATA s attempt at integrating TCQ was constrained by the requirement that ATA host bus adapters use ISA bus device protocols to interact with the operating system The resulting high CPU overhead and negligible performance gain contributed to a lack of market acceptance for TCQ NCQ differs from PATA TCQ in that the command re ordering is performed by the drive rather than the operating system and each command is equal in importance This is preferable since the drive has the most knowledge of its performance characteristics and is able to take rotational position into account NCQ and PATA TCQ have a maximum queue length of in flight commands in flight commands For NCQ to be enabled it must be supported and enabled in the SATA host bus adapter and in the hard drive itself The appropriate device driver must be loaded into the operating system to enable NCQ on the host bus adapter Many newer chipsets support the Advanced Host Controller Interface which should allow a generic driver supplied by the operating system to control them and enable NCQ In fact newer mainstream Linux kernels support AHCI natively Unfortunately Windows XP requires the installation of a vendor specific driver even if AHCI is present on the host bus adapter Windows Vista corrects this situation by including a generic AHCI driver
