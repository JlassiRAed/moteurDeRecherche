We at the Simple English Wikipedia are made up of many WP USER users who write this encyclopedia Some of them know more about certain subjects or topics and write many articles by themselves Some may think that the articles templates or categories they write belong to them They think their pages should not be changed or that they should decide how and when they change They remove any changes made and make it so that others cannot change their pages This goes against our belief in Wikipedia Consensus consensus and is not how we at the Simple English Wikipedia work While we have many articles written by only one person they still belong to everyone Believing that an article or topic has an owner who can control it is a mistake If you know that something on one of our pages is not right you can remove or change it Usually you will have to give a reason why you think it is not right You may even have to WP CITE cite a good source or Wikipedia Rules one of our rules Removing warnings like just because you think a page is yours is not right No matter who you are you must follow our rules and discuss problems with others
