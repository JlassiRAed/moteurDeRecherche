 Hi I m I ve just noticed that Wikipedia Username Our username policy says how you should choose your username Put simply you should not have a username that people find offensive advertises a real world group or company or is confusing If you have already made changes and wish to keep your changes under a new name you may ask for us to Wikipedia Changing username rename your account If you want to please go Special GlobalRenameRequest here and ask for a new name It will be changed by someone once they receive the request If you think that fits inside the guidelines feel free to tell me why on this page and I m sure we can come to some conclusion However please be aware that the username you currently have may be WP BLOCK blocked from editing without warning mdash if your name is listed WP VIP here you may want to tell people why you should not be blocked on that page Thanks again noinclude
