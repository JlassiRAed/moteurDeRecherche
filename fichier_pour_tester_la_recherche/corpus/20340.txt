A sine wave is a curve with this shape This is a picture of a sine wave All wave s can be made by add ing up sine waves The sine wave has a pattern that repeat s The length of this repeating piece of the sine wave is called the wavelength The wavelength can be found by measure measuring the length or distance between one peak of a sine wave and the next peak The wavelength can be found in many other ways too
