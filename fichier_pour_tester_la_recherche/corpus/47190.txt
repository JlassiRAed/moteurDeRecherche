The bladder is an Organ organ in the human body It is the part of our urination All the liquid s that are drunk go through the bladder The bladder takes in the liquid in order for the body to work The bladder works with the kidney s The kidney s clean the liquid we drink This goes on till the bladder is too full to hold any more At this point it is roughly the size of a softball The bladder then tells the brain that it needs to be emptied Once this message is received to the brain the muscle s around the bladder start to squeeze and the bladder starts to contract At the same time the bladder sends a message to the sphincters to relax and let the liquid pass
