A Hilbert space is a Mathematics mathematical concept which is a more general type of Euclidean geometry Euclidean space It takes the mathematics used in two and three dimension s and asks what happens if there are more than three dimensions It is named after David Hilbert Linear algebra Vector algebra and calculus are methods normally used in the two dimensional plane limits have to exist for calculus to work The earliest Hilbert spaces were studied in the first decade of the th century by David Hilbert Erhard Schmidt and Frigyes Riesz John von Neumann first came up with the name Hilbert Space Hilbert space methods made a big difference to functional analysis Hilbert spaces show up a lot in mathematics physics and engineering often as infinite dimensional function space s They are especially useful for studying partial differential equation s quantum mechanics Fourier analysis Hilbert spaces are used in ergodic theory which is the mathematical basis of thermodynamics All normal Euclidean spaces are also Hilbert spaces Other examples of Hilbert spaces include Lp space spaces of square integrable functions Sequence space spaces of sequences Sobolev space s made up of generalized function s and Hardy space s of holomorphic function s
