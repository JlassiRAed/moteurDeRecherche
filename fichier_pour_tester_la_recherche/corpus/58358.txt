An isodesmic reaction is a chemical reaction where the type of chemical bond s broken in the reactant are the same as the type of bonds formed in the reaction product This type of reaction is often used as a hypothetical reaction in thermochemistry An example of an isodesmic reaction is CH X F Cl Br I Equation describes the deprotonation of a methyl halide by a methyl anion The energy change associated with this exothermic reaction can be calculated using a computer The energy change increases going from fluorine to chlorine to bromine and iodine This shows that the CHThe related term homodesmotic reaction also takes into account orbital hybridization Homodesmotic reactions also have the same number of carbon to hydrogen bonds An example of a homodesmotic reaction is c
