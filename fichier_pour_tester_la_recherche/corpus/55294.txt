 last Williams first Dr David R title Moon Fact Sheet publisher NASA url date February accessdate The range of angular size values given are based on simple scaling of the following values given in the fact sheet reference at an Earth equator to Moon centre distance of km the Angular diameter angular size is arcsecond s The same fact sheet gives extreme Earth Moon distances of km and km For the maximum angular size the minimum distance has to be corrected for the Earth s equatorial radius of km giving km The Moon is Earth s natural satellite satellite and we can usually see it in the night sky Other planets also have moons or natural satellites Our moon is about a quarter the size of the Earth Because it is far away it looks small The gravity on the moon is one sixth of the Earth s gravity
