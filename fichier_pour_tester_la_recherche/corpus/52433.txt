The Planck time is the length of time at which no smaller meaningful length can be validly measured due to the indeterminacy expressed in Werner Heisenberg s Heisenberg s uncertainty principle Uncertainty Principle Theoretically this is the shortest time measurement that is possible One Planck time is the time it would take a photon travelling at the speed of light to cross a distance equal to one Planck length It is figured out from the Planck constant which was first thought of by the physics physicist Max Planck in This work by Planck asserts that the energy of a photon is proportional to its frequency and their relation can be put in terms of familiar units such as the joule by using the proportionality constant Planck gave us Heisenberg s original quantum theory was improved by his teacher and colleague Max Born Born put Heisenberg s equation into a Matrix exactly It turns out that we cannot pin down a time any better than we can pin down a place or a momentum We get closer and closer and then we reach the Planck time
