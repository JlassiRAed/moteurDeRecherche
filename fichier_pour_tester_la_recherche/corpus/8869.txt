A nuclear reaction is a process involving an atomic nucleus or more than one nucleus The most common kinds are Nuclear fusion a reaction in which two or more particle s collision collide The wikt result result s are new particles which are different from the first ones Nuclear fission a nucleus breaking into pieces Radioactive decay in which a nucleus spits something out changing itself into a different kind of nucleus In the case of radioactivity the reaction is Fission and fusion can be done on purpose to release energy This energy can then be used for different things for example to make steam It can also be used as energy for a bomb In the example figure Lithium Li fuses with deuterium This makes Beryllium which then decays into two alpha particle s Nuclear reactions occur in the sun in nuclear reactors in particle accelerator s and in outer space Other than radioactive decay very few nuclear reactions occur on earth except in these special places Nuclear reactor s use nuclear reactions to make heat and electricity Accelerators sometimes cause nuclear reactions to make radioactive materials Cosmic rays Particles from outer space cause nuclear reactions in earth s atmosphere that make air slightly radioactive Nuclear reactions differ from chemical reaction s in that they do not need a catalyst Radioactive decay also cannot be stopped sped up or slowed down
