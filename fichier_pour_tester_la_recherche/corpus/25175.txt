 Tajdid which may be translated as revival of the religion The purpose of the tajdid is to implement this ideal model in Muslims lives wherever and whenever Muslim society exists This purpose implies that tajdid is a continuous effort by Muslims always to explain Islam and make it applicable in continually changing situations without violating its pillars of islam principles The notion of tajdid in the Islamic tradition can be traced back to the Prophet Muhammad who said that At the start of each century there will arise in this ummah to clean Islam from all un Godly elements to present Islam and make it flourish more or less in its original pure form and spirit The tradition of a renewal of the faith went back to Islam s first century with the Caliphate caliph Umar II who came to power in the Muslim year and was particularly revered for his piety in contrast to his predecessors He was viewed as a renewer of the faith in an age of increasingly profane rule and later mujaddid s and their movements in various parts of the Islamic world followed his precedent
