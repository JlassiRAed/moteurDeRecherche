The human genome is stored on chromosome pairs in the cell nucleus and in the small mitochondrial DNA A great deal is now known about the DNA sequence sequences of DNA which are on our chromosomes What the DNA actually does is now partly known Applying this knowledge in practice has only just begun The Human Genome Project Nature published the publicly funded project s report The latest project ENCODE studies the way the genes are controlled Walsh Fergus ENCODE The human encyclopaedia BBC News Sci Environment The human genome contains just over protein coding gene s far fewer than had been expected However a single gene can produce a variety of proteins by means of RNA splicing One particular Drosophila gene can be alternatively spliced into different mRNA s Each mRNA codes for a different peptide chain Therefore the number of proteins produced is far above the number of coding genes With RNA splicing and post RNA translation changes the total number of unique human proteins may be in the low millions The idea that most DNA is useless junk is wrong At least of the genome has definite functions
