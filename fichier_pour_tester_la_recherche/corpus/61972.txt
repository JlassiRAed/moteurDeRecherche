 Hawking radiation is black body radiation which is emitted by black hole s due to quantum physics quantum effects near the event horizon It is named after the physicist Stephen Hawking who provided a theoretical argument for its existence in Hawking radiation reduces the mass and the energy of the black hole and is therefore also known as black hole evaporation Because of this black holes that lose more mass than they gain through other means are expected to shrink and ultimately vanish Micro black holes are predicted to be larger net emitters of radiation than larger black holes and should shrink and dissipate faster
