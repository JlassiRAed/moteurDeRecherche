 Supramolecular chemistry is area of chemistry that studies the relationship and linking molecule s into bigger systems It focuses on the chemical systems made up of a discrete number of wikt assembled assembled molecular subunits or wikt component components The study of Noncovalent bonding non covalent interactions is crucial to understanding many biological processes from cell structure to vision that rely on these forces for structure and function Systems biology Biological systems are often the inspiration for supramolecular research
