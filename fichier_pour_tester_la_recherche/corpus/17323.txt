 Bit level parallelism is a form of parallel computing based on increasing processor Word technology Enhancements in computers design s were done by increasing bit level parallelism Increasing the word size reduces the number of instructions the processor must execute in order to perform an operation on variables whose sizes are greater than the length of the word Historically Bit bit microprocessors were replaced with Bit bit then Bit bit then Bit bit microprocessors then Bit bit microprocessors bit processors has been a standard in general purpose computing for about year s but now bit processor s are taking the lead
