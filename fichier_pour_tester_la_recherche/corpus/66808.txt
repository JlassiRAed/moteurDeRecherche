 Potentiometers are variable resistor s Potentiometers are resistors where the resistance can be changed using a knob or a slider Potentiometers are used to control many things including how bright or dim the lights in your house are and the volume controls on your television The idea of a device that could be used to control the amount of electricity going to a component was thought by many people but the carbon potentiometer we commonly use today was invented by Thomas Edison in at the age of He called this device a coiled resistance wire rheostat His patent for this device was issued in Carbon resistors as said above are the most commonly used resistors today They are used in radios to control the volume in televisions to control picture brightness contrast and color response s
