 Ionization energy is the energy needed to take an electron from an atom The atom is not connected to any other atoms The chemical element s to the left of the periodic table have a much lower ionization energy The ones to the right have a much higher ionization energy The chemical element s down the periodic table have a much lower ionization energy The ionization energy increases as each electron is removed
