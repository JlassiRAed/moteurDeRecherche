In writing and typography a ligature is when two or more grapheme s are joined as a single glyph Ligatures usually replace two characters next to each other The idea comes from handwriting and manuscripts Example the common ampersand represents the Latin conjunction et meaning and The ampersand s symbol is a ligature joining the old handwritten Latin letters e and t of the word et so that the word is represented as a single glyph Sometimes ligatures are made to make things more easy to read or simply to make the writing font nicer to look at This is important in some forms of design work Type designers who create fonts It is actually a separate symbol that has been drawn by the creator and is programmed to appear when two letters are put next to each other
