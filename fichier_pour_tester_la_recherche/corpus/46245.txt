 Lady s slipper orchids are the Orchidaceae orchid s in the subfamily Cypripedioideae They are special because of their slipper shaped pouches on their flowers The pouch traps insects so that they must climb up past the modified stamen s where they get or give pollen fertilizing the flower Some people think this subfamily should be different from the Orchidaceae as a family Cypripediaceae
