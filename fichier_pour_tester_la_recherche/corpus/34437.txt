All planets in our solar system follow an Ellipse elliptical path This path is known as an orbit Earth s orbit is not a perfect circle If you were to draw the Earth s orbit on a sheet of paper as a perfect circle the width of the line would be larger than the elliptical path of the Earth The Earth s orbit takes about days this is also called a year This means that in days the Earth has gone completely around the Sun From this we can find that the Earth is actually moving at about miles per hour through space The closest distance Earth is to the sun or perihelion is million km just over eight minutes to travel from Sun to Earth The seasonal changes on Earth are because of the degree axial tilt of its rotation and slightly elliptical path around the Sun The orbit varies over long periods of time according to the Milankovitch cycle s These cycles are one of the main causes of climate change
