When a person commits a capital offence capital crime a mitigating factor is something that might help the person avoid getting the death penalty Mitigating factors do not automatically result in decreased punishment Judge s and jury juries also think about aggravating factor s things that are likely to cause a more severe punishment Also mitigating factors are not an excuse for committing a crime They may help explain what caused a person to commit a crime but they do not mean the person did nothing wrong
