 Island dwarfism or insular dwarfism is the reduction in size of large animals over a number of generation s The same process can happen in evolution on a mainland an example is the evolution of the dwarfed marmoset s and tamarin s among New World monkeys The smallest member is Cebuella pygmaea The main cause is their population s range being limited to a small environment and this happens most often on islands This process has occurred many times throughout evolutionary history Examples include dinosaur s like Europasaurus and modern animals such as elephants and their relatives This process can occur not only on traditional islands but also in other situations where an ecosystem is isolated from external resources and breeding It may include caves desert oasis oases isolated valleys and isolated mountains Insular dwarfism is one aspect of the more general island rule that when mainland animals colonize islands small species tend to evolve larger bodies and large species tend to evolve smaller bodies
