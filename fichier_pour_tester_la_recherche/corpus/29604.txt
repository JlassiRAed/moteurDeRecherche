The Zip drive is a data storage device The company Iomega published it in late Originally it only supported Megabyte MB disks but later versions began to support MB and MB disks Now capacities have reached Gigabyte GB and GB disks Higher capacity Zip disks must be used in a drive with at least the same capacity ability Generally higher capacity drives also handle all lower capacity media However it is slower to write data on a MB disk with a MB Zip drive than with a MB Zip drive Zip drives can transmit data to the computer in various ways Internal drives have been made with IDE and SCSI interfaces External drives can use SCSI parallel port or USB interface Zip disks are thicker than inch floppy disk s Nevertheless zip disks are quite similar in appearance to regular floppy disks This means the Zip drive slot is large enough to accept such a floppy disk
