The masked booby Sula dactylatra is a large seabird of the booby family Sulidae These birds often fight each other for certain types of fish Many adults will create a flock of their own to take down a school of fish but many boobies hunt alone so their catch is not stolen by the other birds in the area They are often mistaken for the common seagull due to the primary white color on its feathers
