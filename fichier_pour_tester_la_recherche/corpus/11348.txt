 Buphagus africanus Buphagus erythrorhynchus The oxpeckers are the two species of bird which make up the family family Buphagidae Oxpeckers are endemic to the savanna of Sub Sahara n Africa Their names come from their habit of perching on large mammal s such as cattle or rhinoceros es and eating tick s botfly larva e and other parasite s According to the more recent studies of phylogeny the oxpeckers are an ancient line related to the Mimidae and starling s but not particularly close to either Considering the known biogeography of these groups the most plausible explanation seems that the oxpecker lineage originated in Eastern or Southeastern Asia like the other two This would make the two species of Buphagus something like living fossil s
