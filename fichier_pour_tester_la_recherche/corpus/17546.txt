The MIPS architecture is an instruction set for computer s that was developed at Stanford University in At the start MIPS was an acronym for Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipeline Stages Most of it is done in Reduced instruction set computer RISC In a full RISC architecture all commands have the same length This simplifies the design of the microchip and allows to use fast clock cycles At the start the architecture used a bit Computer bus bus but from a bit architecture was used In MIPS implementations are primarily used in embedded system s such as Windows CE devices router s Gateway Playstation PlayStation and PlayStation Portable Until late they were also used in many of Silicon Graphics SGI s computer products MIPS implementations were also used by Digital Equipment Corporation NEC Pyramid Technology Siemens Nixdorf Tandem Computers and others during the late s and s In the mid to late s it was estimated that one in three RISC microprocessors produced was a MIPS implementation
