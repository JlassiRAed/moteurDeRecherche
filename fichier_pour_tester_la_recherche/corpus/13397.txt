In graph theory a graph is used to represent the connection between two set s One of the sets contains nodes There are two classes of graphs which are distinguished by the nature of the edges Some edges can be travelled in both directions other can only be travelled in one direction Edges that can be travelled in one direction only are called directed and the graph is called a directed graph or digraph The ones which do not have a direction are called undirected and the graph is called an undirected graph If two vertices are connected by an edge they are called adjacent The order of a graph written as the number of edges The degree of a vertex is the number of edges that connect to it where an edge that connects to the vertex at both ends is counted twice Vertices or edges may have weights In general weigts are used to show the costs associated with using the respective vertex or edge In a graph that shows the cities of a region the cost associated with a vertex may be the distance between two cities or the amount of time it takes to travel between the two A graph were there is more than one edge between two vertices is called multigraph one where there is at most one edge is called a simple graph A loop is an edge that connects to the same vertex Loops are only allowed in multigraphs A simple graph where every vertex is directly connected to every other is called complete graph A sequence of vertices where two vertices which are next to each other in the sequence are connected by an edge is called a path A path which starts and ends at the same edge is called a cycle The directed graph below with a cycle has the paths BCEDB CEDBC EDBCE andDBCED which are cycles File n graf svg An undirected graph with six vertices and seven edges File Directed graph cyclic svg A directed graph with a cycleFile Directed acyclic graph svg A directed graph without a cycleFile Cyclic graph svg Undirected graph with the cycle highlighted in redFile Multi pseudograph svg A multigraph with multiple edges Not all authors allow multigraphs to have loops File n graph svg A graph with a loop on vertex Vertex has a degree of vertices to have a degree and vertex has a degree of File Complete graph K svg A complete graph with vertices
