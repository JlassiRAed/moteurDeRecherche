 DorlandsID Palate The palate is the roof of the mouth in humans and other mammal s It separates the oral cavity from the nasal cavity A similar structure is found in crocodilia but in most other tetrapod s the oral and nasal cavities are not truly separate The palate is divided into two parts the anterior bony hard palate and the posterior fleshy soft palate or velum The hard palate is formed before birth If the fusion is not complete it is called a cleft palate This is a birth or congenital defect As the roof of the mouth was once considered the seat of the sense of taste palate can also refer to this sense itself as in the phrase a discriminating palate By further extension the flavour of a food may be called its palate
