 Hematopoiesis is the formation of blood cells Hematopoietic stem cells of most bones As a stem cell matures it undergoes changes in gene expression which limit the cell types it can become It moves closer to a specific cell type These changes can often be tracked by monitoring the presence of proteins on the cell membrane surface of the cell Each successive change moves the cell closer to the final cell type and limits its potential to become a different cell type HSC studies through much of the past half century have led to a much deeper understanding More recent advances have resulted in the use of HSC transplants in the treatment of cancers and other immune system disorders
