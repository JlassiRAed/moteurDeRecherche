 Electric power is defined as the power dissipated by an electric circuit Electric power is a measurement of the rate at which energy is used over a period of time The SI unit for power is the watt the unit for energy is the joule and the unit for time is the second and the unit for electric current is the ampere When electric current flows through a circuit its slowed down by the electrical resistance resistance in the circuit Devices can convert this current to useful forms of work work such as heat radiation light emission kinetic energy mechanical motion or sound acoustic vibrations
