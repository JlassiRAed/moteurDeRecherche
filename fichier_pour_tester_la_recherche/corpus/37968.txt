A stop codon is special sequence in the genetic code It is a nucleotide triplet in messenger RNA that signals the end of translation translation It is a codon genetic translation They are also called termination codons or chain termination codons There are three such codons UAA UAG and UGA Protein s are based on polypeptide s which are unique sequences of amino acid s Most codons in messenger RNA correspond to the addition of an amino acid to a growing polypeptide chain which may ultimately become a protein Stop codons indicate the end of this process and therefore the end of polypeptide polypeptide synthesis
