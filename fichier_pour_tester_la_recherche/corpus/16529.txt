 The Symphony No in C major K is a work for orchestra It was written by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart in It is his last symphony Michael Rodman writes in the All Music Guide to Classical Music that the first movement is characterized in part by the dramatic and effective employment of unexpected pauses in the rhythmic flow through the use of rests and that irregular and changing phrase length contribute to the dramatic impetus He writes that the serene F major second movement is disrupted by minor key episodes and that this light dark conflict continues throughout He points out that the gracefulness of the Minuet can be attributed to the flowing even accompaniment and the falling chromatic theme The trio has an earthier more overtly dancelike mood he writes but is interrupted by a suddenly more serious outburst from the full orchestra The counterpoint contrapuntal fourth movement is filled with great tension and dramatic impulse that is resolved only in the final bars
