 Cytokines are signalling molecules made by cells They help to control the immune system and fight disease They are similar to hormones and as we learn more about each distinctions between the two are fading Cytokines carry signals locally between cells and these signals have an effect on other cells Some well known cytokines include interferon prostaglandin and interleukin s Cytokines can be detected using the ELISA and ELISPOT techniques Cytokines work by signal transduction Each cytokine has a matching Receptor cell surface receptor Then cascade s of signals inside the cell changes cell functions This may include the gene regulation regulation of several genes the production of other cytokines or an increase in surface receptors for other molecules
