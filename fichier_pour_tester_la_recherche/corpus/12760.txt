Putting two or more liquid s together creates an emulsion if the liquids do not mix Immiscible liquids do not mix together For example if you add oil to water the oil floats on the surface of the water And if you shake the two together then leave them to stand tiny droplets of oil float upwards These droplets join together until eventually the oil is floating on the water again To stop the two liquids separating we need a substance called an emulsifier Emulsifiers are molecules that have two different ends a hydrophilic end that forms chemical bonds with water but not with oils and a hydrophobic end that forms chemical bonds with oils but not with water
