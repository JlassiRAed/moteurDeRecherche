 Lorentz s law is a law discovered by the Dutch physicist Hendrik Antoon Lorentz Lorentz s law defines force that acts on moving charged particles in an electromagnetic field Force consists of magnetic force and electric force F qE If the charge is positive the direction of the electric force is equal to direction of electric field F qv B The direction of the magnetic force is given by the right hand rule If charged particles move with velocity v in an electric field E and a magnetic field BF qE qv BF force q charge E electric field v velocity of particle B magnetic field Using this law J J Thomson measured mass to charge ratio
