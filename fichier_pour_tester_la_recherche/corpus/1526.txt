 Polaris is the Pole Star or North Star It is the brightest star in the constellation Ursa Minor It is almost straight above Earth s north pole Because of this when it is seen from Earth it looks like it always stays in the same place in the sky Many years ago sailor s in the northern hemisphere used Polaris to help them figure out where they were on the ocean and what way they were moving There are some interesting facts about Polaris The first is that it is part of a triple star system It has a very close dwarf binary and a larger star Polaris B which orbits Astronomical unit AU away The main Polaris A star is a giant with times the mass of the Sun It is a classic Cepheid variable the closest to us in the whole Milky Way Polaris B can be seen even with a modest telescope It was found by William Herschel in using one of the most powerful telescope s of the time his own reflecting telescope The nearby dwarf star Ab was predicted in but only seen quite recently The dwarf orbits as close to A as Uranus is to our sun Even though Polaris is the North Star today this has not always been the case The place in the sky that the Earth s north pole points at changes slowly over time This movement is called stellar precession In BC a faint star called Thuban in the constellation of Draco Draco was the North Star Polaris did not become the North Star until about AD It will get closer to straight above the Earth s north pole until sometime in Then it will move away again It will be the closest star to the pole until about AD Surprisingly considering its relative nearness its distance is not yet known for certain Many recent papers calculate the distance to Polaris at about light years
