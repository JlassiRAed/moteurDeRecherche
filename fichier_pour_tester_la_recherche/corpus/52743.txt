The Late Heavy Bombardment Mercury Venus and Mars as well The evidence for this event comes from the radiometric dating dating of lunar Sample samples which indicates that most impact melt rocks formed at that time Many hypotheses have been suggested to explain how asteroid al or comet ary material got into the inner solar system but no consensus yet exists One popular theory is that the gas giant planets migrated in orbit at this time causing objects in the asteroid belt and or Kuiper belt to be forced into orbits which reached the terrestrial planet s Some think that the apparent clustering of impact melt ages near this time is an artifact of sampling
