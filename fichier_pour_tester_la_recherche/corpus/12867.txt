A cryptography cryptographic hash function is a hash function which takes an input The ideal hash function has three main properties It is extremely easy to calculate a hash for any given data It is Computational complexity theory extremely computationally difficult to calculate an alphanumeric text that has a given hash It is extremely unlikely that two slightly different messages will have the same hash
