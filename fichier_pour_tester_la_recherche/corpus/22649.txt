 Sir Joseph John J J Thomson Order of Merit was a British people British physicist and Nobel laureate He discovered the electron and isotopes and invented the mass spectrometer He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in for his discovery of the electron and his work on the conduction of electricity in gases John Joseph Thomson in said There is no other branch of physics which affords us so promising an opportunity of penetrating the secret of electricity In Thomson showed that cathode ray s were composed of a previously unknown negatively charged particle later called the electron as the first subatomic particle to be found Thomson also found the first evidence for isotope s of a stable In atomic theory he hypothesized that atoms were spheres of evenly spread positive charge where an individual negatively charged electron resided He later concluded there was more than one negatively charged particle in an atom
