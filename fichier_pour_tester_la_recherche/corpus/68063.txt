 Amplitude Modulation usually shortened to AM is a simple way to send a radio signal The signal can travel long distances and appear in faraway places because of the earth s Kennelly Heaviside layer ionosphere Amplitude is the height of a wave A wiktionary carrier wave carrier wave is wiktionary modulate modulated by adding audio The combined signal is wiktionary transmit transmitted over a frequency AM signals can be received by a crystal powered crystal radio radio set that needs no battery batteries or electrical wiktionary power source power source Many early radios were homemade and used wiktionary earphone earphones AM signals are mostly sent out on wiktionary medium wave medium wave and wiktionary shortwave shortwave frequency frequencies They do not carry high fidelity sound but the sound is good enough to hear most things Analog signal s can fade in and out or have wikt interference interference from wiktionary power line power lines and power station s Sunspot activity can also weaken signals In the early years of Commerce commercial broadcasting in the s medium wave AM was the only kind of radio widely used Radio program s were much like today s television programming with news sports drama music comedy and other entertainment Later Frequency modulation Frequency Modulation radio was developed It had better wiktionary fidelity fidelity but the signals could not travel as far so AM was still important After television became common in the s AM became a major wikt format format for popular music As FM became common in the s AM stations featured more news and talk show s Shortwave radio signals can travel around the world and are used by country countries to send programs to distant places These programs feature news about the country examples of their native culture and history and sometimes wiktionary foreign language foreign language lessons
