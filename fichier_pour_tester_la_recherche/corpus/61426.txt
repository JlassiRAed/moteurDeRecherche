In mathematics the polar coordinate system is a dimension two dimensional coordinate system in which each point plane is determined by an angle and a distance The polar coordinate system is especially useful in situations where the relationship between two points is most easily expressed with angles and distance in the more familiar Cartesian coordinate system Cartesian or rectangular coordinate system such a relationship can only be found through trigonometry trigonometric formulae As the coordinate system is two dimensional each point is determined by two polar coordinates the radial coordinate and the angular coordinate The radial coordinate cite book
