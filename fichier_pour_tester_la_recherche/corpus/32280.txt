 Frequency is how often an event repeats itself over a set amount of time In physics the frequency of a wave is the number of wave Hertz is the unit of frequency The relationship between Frequency and wavelength is expressed by the formula where v is speed and where the c is the speed of light All electromagnetic waves travel at the speed of light in a vacuum but they travel at slower speeds when they travel through a medium that is not a vacuum Other waves such as sound waves travel at much much lower speeds and can not travel through a vacuum Examples of electromagnetic waves are light waves radio wave s infrared radiation microwaves and Gamma ray gamma waves
