Next up for the QandA interview is User Juliancolton Juliancolton with new resident interviewer Lets see how he gets on Let s get started then Please tell me a bit about yourself Who are you what do you do Hi I m Juliancolton I m an administrator at three Wikimedia projects I passed simplewiki RfA in January and since then I ve edited near daily My work here includes article writing vandal fighting and general maintenance work Sounds cool and quite busy So what do you like most about Wikipedia That s a tough call I ve always liked the concept of spreading knowledge for free and I especially enjoy collaborating with other editors on the project Yes I think that is one of the good things about Wikipedia i know that i ve certainly made lots of friends on it So when and or how did you first find Wikipedia I was browsing an external site and stumbled upon a link to the English Wikipedia I found it to be very informative and I typed a couple other things into the search box I was amazed at the broad coverage the project had After editing there for a couple years I worked my way over to simplewiki and the rest is history So you ve been around for quite a while then what keeps you at Wikipedia Well aside from what I mentioned above I m a true wikiholic More importantly the work isn t going to do itself so I like to help out Ok So what do you like the least about Wikipedia Well it is a volunteer project so it s not perfect ok is there one thing in particular you would like to change I think it would be nice if we could focus on making decent articles rather than one line stubs which basically repeat the title Yes I agree on that too Which reminds me I need to go and do some more on Victoria Line Ok last question Is there anything you want to say plug shout out to etc Hmm well tropical cyclone articles need quite a bit of work if anyone s interested Thanks a lot for your time I hope some people drop by soon Thanks for the interview Well thanks for that Julian Look out for more QandA interviews in future editions May UTC
