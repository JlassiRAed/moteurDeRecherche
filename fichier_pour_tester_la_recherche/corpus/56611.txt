A Video CD or VCD is a Compact disc CD that contains a movie instead of music or a computer program It is the little brother of the DVD Since a DVD can store ten times as much information as a VCD the quality of a VCD is not as high as that of a DVD but it is ten times cheaper to make The quality of the picture is about as good as an analog television with a simple antenna or a VHS tape
