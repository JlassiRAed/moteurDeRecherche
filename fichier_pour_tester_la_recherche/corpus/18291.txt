 Shake table in earthquake engineering is a very effective experimental equipment to verify seismic performance associated with the direct damage to individual buildings or their building model models under specified earthquake ground shaking The best way to do it is to put a building structure on a shake table that Earthquake performance simulation simulates the earth shaking and to watch what may happen next The earliest shake table experiments were performed more than a century ago
