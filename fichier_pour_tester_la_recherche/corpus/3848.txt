In statistics and probability theory correlation means how closely related two set s of Information data are Correlation does not always mean that one causes the other It is very possible that there is a third factor involved Correlation usually has one of two directions These are positive or negative If it is positive then the two sets go up together If it is negative then one goes up while the other goes down Lots of different measurements of correlation are used for different situations For example on a scatter graph people draw a line of best fit to show the direction of the correlation
