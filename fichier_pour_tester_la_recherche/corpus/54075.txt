 Canonisation is a statement by a church saying that someone is a saint This process is used by some Christian churches most commonly in the Catholicism Roman Catholic Church The person must be dead because living people cannot be canonised The process of canonisation involves proving that the person lived in a way that wikt justify justifies this decision They must have loved others and loved God In the Catholic Church at least two Miracle miracles by the saint s intercession must be proven This means that because the person is believed to be in heaven someone must pray or ask for the saint to pray for them in heaven If the prayer is answered and a miracle happens then they know that the person is a saint The miracles prove that the saint must be in heaven with God and able to ask God for prayers to be answered These people then enter into the canon or list of saints It is not correct to say that the Church makes someone a saint The Catholic Church believes that anyone who is in heaven is already a saint The canonisation process just finds out for sure or without a doubt that someone is a saint
