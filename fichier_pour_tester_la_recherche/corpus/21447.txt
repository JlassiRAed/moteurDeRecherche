 Refraction is the change in direction of a Wave wave caused by the change in the wave s speed Examples of waves include sound sound waves and light light waves Refraction is seen most often when a wave passes from one Media medium to a different medium Different types of medium include air and water When a wave passes from one medium to another medium the wave will change its speed and its direction For example when a light wave travels through air and then passes through water the wave will slow and change direction As light travels through the refractive device it will bend toward the normal Normal in geometry means vertical it will return along the same angle as when it entered the device An example of how refraction works is placing a straw in a cup of water with part of the straw in the water When looking at a certain angle the straw appears to bend at the water s surface This is because of the bending of light rays as they move between the air and the water A good and simple way to understand how light works is to think of it like a car When the car hits the gravel surface Lenses work by refraction When light refracts in a prism prism it splits into colours of the rainbow because some wavelength s bend more than others
