The general intelligence factor often shortened to g is a construct from psychology It is the common factor in intelligence tests It is the result of measuring intelligence in different ways Charles Spearman an early statistician and psychologist found that school children s grades across unrelated subjects were strongly related to each other That is to say children who were good at one area He then proposed that these relationships reflected the influence of a dominant factor which he called g for general intelligence He developed a model where all variation in intelligence test scores can be explained by two factors The first is the factor specific to an individual mental task the individual abilities that would make a person more skilled at one cognitive task than another The second is g a general factor that governs performance on all cognitive tasks After years of cognitive testing g s central role is still a meaningful measure Other models have also been proposed and there is significant controversy about g and its alternatives
