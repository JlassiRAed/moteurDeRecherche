The rate equation is an equation used to calculate the speed of a chemical reaction For a general reaction the rate equation is Here A and B are the concentration s of A and B x and y depend on which step is rate determining step rate determining If the reaction mechanism is a very simple one where A and B hit each other and then go to products through one transition state then x a and y b k is the rate constant of the reaction This changes with temperature pressure and other conditions The rate equation is a differential equation If it is integral integrated then an equation which tells how the concentration of reagents and products changes with time is found In special cases it is very easy to solve the equation and find k For example in a first order reaction the equation is Integrating gives So a plot of Sometimes experiments can be made so that the reaction looks like a first order one If the concentration of one reagent is kept at the same high value then it can be thought of as a constant The equation becomes where k is the pseudo first order rate constant Then the method above can be used to calculate k cy Cyfradd adwaith Hafaliadau cyfradd
