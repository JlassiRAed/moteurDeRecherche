A herd is a large group of animal s The term is used for mammal s particularly ungulate hoofed animals Herding is a good example of collective animal behavior Other terms are used for similar Phenomenon types of behavior in other types of animal For example a large group of birds is usually called a flock and a large group of Carnivora carnivores is usually called a pack In addition special collective nouns may be used for particular cases for example a flock of geese if not in flight is sometimes called a gaggle However in theoretical discussions in behavioural ecology the term herd is used for all these kinds of assemblage A herd may also refer to one that wikt tend tends and cares for such groups When an association of animals but that this does not occur as a result of planning or co ordination Rather each individual is choosing behaviour that corresponds to that of the majority of other members possibly through imitation or possibly because all are responding to the same external circumstances A herd can be contrasted with a co ordinated group where individuals have distinct roles Many human groupings such as an army detachments or sports teams show such co ordination and differentiation of roles but so do some animal groupings such as those of eusocial insect s which are co ordinated through pheromone s and other forms of animal communication Conversely some human groupings may behave more like herds
