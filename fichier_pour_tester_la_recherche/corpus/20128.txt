A protease is a digestive enzyme It breaks down long chains of protein s into shorter amino acids Proteases have convergent evolution evolved a number of times We know this because different kinds of protease can do the same reaction in completely different ways Proteases are found in animal s plant s bacteria archaea and virus es Now more than types of protease are known Each is a separate evolutionary origin of proteolysis MEROPS the peptide database Protease can be divided into types serine proteases threonine proteases cysteine proteases aspartate proteases metallo proteases glutamic acid proteases
