In the fields of communication s signal processing and in electrical engineering more generally a signal is any time varying quantity The concept is broad and hard to define precisely Definitions specific to subfields are common For example in information theory a signal is a codified message i e the sequence of states in a communications channel that encodes a message In a communications system a transmitter encodes a message into a signal which is carried to a receiver by the communications channel For example the words Mary had a little lamb might be the message spoken into a telephone The telephone transmitter converts the sounds into an electrical volt age signal The signal is transmitted to the receiving telephone by wires and at the receiver it is reconverted into sounds
