 Hydrogen peroxide is a chemical compound Its molecular formula is H It is used as a cleaner and as hair bleach In a concentration it can be used to treat wound s Over time it will slowly become oxygen gas and water through decomposition Chemistry Chemists often use hydrogen peroxide in chemical reaction s It is a very strong redox oxidising agent when used with acid and water Oxidising agents take electron s from other compounds FeHere hydrogen peroxide takes an electron from the Fe ion s and becomes water It can also be a redox reducing agent when used with other compounds When it acts as a reducing agent oxygen gas is also produced Reducing agents give electron s to other compounds This method is often used to make oxygen in laboratory laboratories NaOCl HOHydrogen peroxide can be bought in shops when mixed with lots of water but is very dangerous when the concentration is higher It is flammable and causes burn s
