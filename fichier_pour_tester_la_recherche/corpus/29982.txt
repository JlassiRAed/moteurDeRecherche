In Internet terminology a private network is typically a network that uses private IP address space following the RFC standard Computers may be allocated addresses from this address space when it is necessary for them to communicate with other computing devices on an Intranet network Private networks are quite common in home and office local area network designs as many organizations do not see a need for globally unique IP addresses for every computer computer printer printer and other devices that the organizations use Private IP addresses were created due to the shortage of publicly registered IP addresses created by the Internet Protocol IPv standard One of the reasons Internet Protocol IPv was created is to overcome this limitation of the Internet Protocol IPv standard However Internet Protocol IPv still did not achieve a widespread use Router s on the Internet should be configured to discard any packets containing private IP addresses in the IP packet header This isolation gives private networks a basic form of security as it is not usually possible for the outside world to establish a connection directly to a machine using these private addresses As connections cannot be made between different private networks via the internet different organizations can use the same private address range without risking address conflicts If a device on a private network needs to communicate with other networks a mediating gateway so that Internet router s allow the communication This gateway is typically a network address translation NAT device or a proxy server Public Internet Router s by default will not forward packets with RFC addresses Unlike public Internet router s that need additional configuration to forward these packets internal router s do not need any additional configuration to forward these packets This can cause problems however when organizations try to connect networks that both use the same private address spaces There is a potential for clashes and routing problems if both networks use the same IP addresses for their private networks or if both networks depend on NAT to connect them through the Internet
