The adaptive unconscious is a set of unconscious mental processes influencing judgment and decision making It is different from conscious processing it is faster effortless more focused on the present but less flexible In other theories of the mind the unconscious is limited to low level activity such as carrying out goals which have been decided consciously In contrast the adaptive unconscious is thought to be involved in high level cognition such as goal setting as well The term adaptive unconscious suggests it has wikt survival survival value and hence is an adaptation which was strongly natural selection selected in the past Indeed for much of vertebrate evolution all mental activity was unconscious No one supposes that fish have consciousness Thus our consciousness is added to an already existing set of mechanisms which operate but whose operation is normally not felt by us
