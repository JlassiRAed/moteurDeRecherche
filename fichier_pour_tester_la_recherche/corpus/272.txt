 Apollo was the seventh mission of NASA s Project Apollo and the third manned lunar lander mission The flight was commanded by Jim Lovell The other astronauts on board were Jack Swigert and Fred Haise The craft was launched successfully toward the Moon but two days after launch a faulty oxygen tank exploded and the Apollo Command Service Module Service Module became damaged causing a loss of oxygen and electrical power There was a very large chance that the astronauts would die before they could return to Earth They were very short of oxygen Oxygen is not just used to breathe on the Apollo spacecraft it was used in a device called a Fuel cell to generate electricity So they conserved their remaining air by turning off almost all their electrical equipment including heaters It became very cold in the spacecraft In order to stay alive the astronauts also had to move into the Apollo Lunar Module and make it work as a sort of lifeboat When they approached the Earth they were not sure that their parachutes needed to slow the Command Module down would work The parachutes were thrown out by small explosive charges that were fired by battery batteries The cold could have made the batteries fail in which case the parachutes would not work and the Command Module would hit the ocean so fast that all aboard would be killed
