 Electromagnets are temporary and artificial magnets They are magnet s that are only magnetism magnetic when there is a coil of wire with electricity running through it This is called a solenoid The strength of the magnet is proportion al to the Electric current current flowing in the Electrical circuit circuit The electricity running through the wire is called a current The current is the flow of electron s which are negatively charged particles Electromagnets are used for a variety of purposes In a simple example an electromagnet can pick up pieces of iron nickel and cobalt Electromagnets can be made stronger by adding more coils to the copper wire or adding an iron core through the coils The current can also be increased to make the magnetism stronger British electrician William Sturgeon invented the electromagnet in An electromagnet is very beneficial because it can be turned on and off easily side of the battery Electromagnets are used in everyday items such as burglar alarms electric relay s and fire bells Electric motor s are basically electromagnets Their ability to change from the state of non magnetic to magnetic just by passing an electric current through it allows it to be used in many different items This ability is used in relay s Electromagnets can also be used to make electricity Movement of a magnet back and forth in front of the electromagnet will make an electric current
