The Five color theorem is a theorem from Graph theory It states that any plane which is separated into regions such as a map can be colored with no more than five colors It was first stated by Alfred Kempe in and proved by Percy John Heawood eleven years later Kempe also tried to prove it but his proof failed There are two restrictions which are placed on the maps First a country must be contiguous there must be no exclave s and secondly countries that only touch in one point can be colored with the same color There is also a four color theorem which is stronger and much more difficult to prove category Graph theory
