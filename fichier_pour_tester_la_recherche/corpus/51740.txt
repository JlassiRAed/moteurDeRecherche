A scientific model is a simplified abstract view of a complex reality Scientific models are used as a basis for scientific work They can be used to explain predict and test or to develop computer programs or mathematical equation s An example of a complex model is the software used for weather forecast s The program is based on equations for the variable s which affect weather Meteorology Meteorological data is fed in and the program produces predictions of future weather patterns A scientific model represents complex objects events and physical processes in a logic al way They are an image of an original which can be a model itself Scientific models only have those details of the object or image modeled that are relevant There is no strict mapping between a model and the original object it models Models may be valid only for a given time interval for a given object or for a given purpose
