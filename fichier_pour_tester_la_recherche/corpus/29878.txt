 Sidney Altman is a Canada Canadian United States American molecular biology molecular biologist He is currently Professor of Molecular Cellular and Developmental Biology and Chemistry at Yale University In he shared the Nobel Prize in Chemistry with Thomas Cech for their work on the catalytic properties of RNA Altman s Nobel Prize work came with the analysis of the catalytic properties of the ribozyme RNase P RNase P is a ribonucleoprotein particle part RNA and part protein Originally it was thought that in the bacterial RNase P complex the protein subunit was responsible for the catalytic activity of the complex During experiments in which the complex was taken apart and put together in test tubes Altman and his group discovered a remarkable thing The RNA component in isolation was enough for the observed catalytic activity of the enzyme This was remarkable because previously it was thought that only enzymes could catalyse reactions in living cells Altman s research showed that RNA itself had catalytic properties This was the discovery that earned him the Nobel prize Although the RNase P complex also exists in eukaryotic organisms Altman s later work showed that in eukaryotes the protein subunits are essential to the catalytic activity in contrast to the bacterial RNase P
