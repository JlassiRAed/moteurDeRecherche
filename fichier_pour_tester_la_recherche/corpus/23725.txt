 Spectroscopy is the study of light as a function of length of the wave that has been light emitted reflection reflected or shone through a wikt solid solid liquid or gas Many times it is analyzed when the chemical is heated because it makes a special color of flame Most chemicals make a different color or spectrum than other chemicals This can be used to see what chemicals are in a substance Spectroscopy allows scientists to investigate and explore things that are too small to be seen through a microscope such as molecule s and the even smaller subatomic particles like proton s neutron s and electron s There are special instruments to Measurement measure and Analysis analyse these light waves
