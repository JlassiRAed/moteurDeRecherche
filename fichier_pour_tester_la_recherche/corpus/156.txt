 Thermal conductivity is the ability of a material to conduct heat Metals are good at heat conduction They are good conductors of heat Gases are also good at moving heat They are also good conductors of heat Thermal resistivity is the opposite of thermal conductivity This means not conduction conducting heat much Materials with high resistivity are called thermal insulators and are used in clothing to keep people warm or in refrigerator s to keep things cold Thermal conductivity is often represented by the Greek letter Kappa An example of thermal conductivity is when you put spoons in boiling water One spoon is steel and the other is silver When you take the spoons out of the boiling water the silver spoon is hotter than the steel spoon The reason for this is that silver conducts heat better than steel
