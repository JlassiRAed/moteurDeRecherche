 MD is a special algorithm a mathematical process used to make computer information secure and safe It is mainly used for security in database systems The algorithm generates a unique hash code for every piece of data Any change to the data either deliberate or accidental will mean the hash code will also change By comparing the codes it is easy to see if a change has been made MD was invented by Ron Rivest of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in An MD hash code is usually a digit hexadecimal number By methods were developed to break the security of an MD algorithm This was done by getting another program to make the same hash number for different sets of data MD is no longer considered acceptable for protecting against intentional malicious changes to data but it is still considered OK to protect from accidental changes for example single bit changes caused by noise on a network connection
