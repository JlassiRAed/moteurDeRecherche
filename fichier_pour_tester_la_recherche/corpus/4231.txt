A programming language is a type of written language that tells computers what to do in order to work Programming languages are used to make all the computer programs and computer software A programming language is like a set of instructions that the computer follows to do something A programmer writes source code text in the programming language to create programs Usually the programming language uses real words for some of the commands so that the language is easier for a human to read Many programming languages use punctuation just like a normal language Many programs now are compiled This means that the computer translates the source code into another language which is much faster and easier for the computer to read but much harder for a person to read Computer programs must be written very carefully If the programmer makes mistakes or the program tries to do something the programmer did not design it to do the program might then crash or stop working When a program has a problem because of how the code was written this is called a Software bug bug A very small mistake can cause a very big problem For example forgetting a comma or typing a plus sign instead of a minus sign can cause a bad bug
