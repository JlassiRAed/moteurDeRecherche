The Huronian glaciation to mya during the Palaeoproterozoic era It was named after evidence was collected from Lake Huron region in North America There three separate horizons of glacial deposits are separated by non glacial sediment It was one of the most severe and longest ice age s in geologic history similar to the Snowball Earth ice ages that happened in the Neoproterozoic era The glaciations were probably triggered by the Great Oxygenation Event and eventually supplied free oxygen to the atmosphere The alternate warm and ice age periods was probably caused by a repeating cycle Cyanobacteria flourished in the warm periods producing huge amounts of oxygen The oxygen removed the free methane and used up carbon dioxide This caused the temperature to crash This slowed down the bacteria So the temperature rose again However it is also possible that there was a million year lull in Volcano volcanic activity resulting in lower carbon dioxide levels and so reduced greenhouse effect
