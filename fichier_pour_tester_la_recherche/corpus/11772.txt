 Australopithecus anamensis is a species of Australopithecus The first fossilized specimen of the species though not recognized as such at the time was a single arm bone found in Pliocene strata in the Kanapoi region of East Lake Turkana by a Harvard University research team in The specimen was tentatively assigned at the time to Australopithecus and dated about four million years old Little additional information was uncovered until when Canadian Archaeology archaeologist Allan Morton discovered fragments of a specimen sticking out of a partially eroded hillside east of Allia Bay near Lake Turkana Kenya Six years later the London born Kenyan paleoanthropologist Meave Leakey and archaeologist Alan Walker excavated the Allia Bay site and uncovered several additional fragments of the hominid including one complete lower jaw bone which closely resembles that of a common chimpanzee but whose teeth are much more similar to those of a human In Meave Leakey and her associates taking note of differences between Australopithecus afarensis and the new finds assigned them to a new species A anamensis deriving its name from the Turkana word anam meaning lake
