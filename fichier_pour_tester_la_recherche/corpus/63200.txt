 CP Violation is the way that nature breaks the laws that say that when you change a system by charge conjugation C symmetry or Parity P symmetry then some descriptions of the system should stay the same before and after the change The violation is that they don t stay the same and the amounts are not conserved CP symmetry says that the laws of physics should act the same on a particle and on its antiparticle The nobel prize was given to James Cronin and Val Fitch for finding CP violation in the way neutral kaons decay
