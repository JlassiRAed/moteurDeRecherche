The greenhouse effect occurs when certain gases in the Earth s atmosphere entraps infrared radiation This makes the planet become warmer similar to the way it makes a greenhouse become warmer The greenhouse effect is caused by greenhouse gas es the most important greenhouse gases in Earth s atmosphere are water vapor carbon dioxide and methane When there is more greenhouse gas in the air the air holds more heat This is why more greenhouse gases cause global warming The greenhouse effect is natural It is important for life on Earth Without the greenhouse effect the Earth s average temperature would be around or degrees Celsius The problem is that recently the greenhouse effect has become stronger This is because humans have been using large amounts of fossil fuel s which release carbon dioxide when they are burned Since carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas it has global warming caused the planet to warm over the past years About ten thousand years ago before people started burning large amounts of fossil fuels there was to parts per million in the atmosphere In September the figure was ppm Most scientists say that having ppm or less is safe for the environment and that species on the planet can adapt to this level Higher levels can make severe problems for animal and marine life that are already being seen today such as ocean acidification The greenhouse effect was first proposed by Joseph Fourier in Mars Venus and other planets with atmospheres also have greenhouse effects The effect on Venus is especially strong because Venus has so much CO This is why Venus is hotter than Mercury could cause global warming was Svante Arrhenius
