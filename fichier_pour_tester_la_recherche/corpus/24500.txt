An exothermic reaction is a reaction where the substance s chemical reaction react chemically to release energy in the form of heat An example of this is combustion Exothermic reactions transfer energy to the surroundings The energy is usually transferred as heat energy causing the reaction mixture and its surroundings to become hotter The temperature increase can be detected using a thermometer Some examples of exothermic reactions are burning neutralisation reactions between acids and alkalis the reaction between water and calcium oxideThe chemical reaction that does the complete opposite and absorbs heat is an endothermic reaction
