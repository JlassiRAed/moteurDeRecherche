In cryptography Blowfish is a key in a large number of encryption products Blowfish has a good encryption rate in software and until no Cryptanalysis cryptanalytic attack model of it has been found However the Advanced Encryption Standard AES block cipher algorithm now has more attention Schneier made Blowfish as a general purpose algorithm to be used as a replacement for the old Data Encryption Standard DES algorithm and to remove the problems and difficulties of other encryption algorithms At the time Blowfish was released many other algorithms were proprietary or were secrets Schneier has said that Blowfish is unpatented and will remain so in all countries The algorithm is hereby placed in the public domain and can be freely used by anyone Main features of the design include key dependent Substitution box S box es and a very complex key schedule Blowfish is one of the fastest block cipher s used by many people except when changing key but it is not a problem in other applications In one of the applications it is actually good the password hashing method used in OpenBSD uses an algorithm that comes from Blowfish which makes use of the slow key schedule the idea is that the extra computational effort required gives protection against dictionary attack s See key strengthening Blowfish has a bit block size block size and a variable Key size key length from up to bits cite paper It is a round Feistel cipher and uses large key dependent Substitution box S boxes It is similar in structure to CAST which uses fixed S boxes In Serge Vaudenay found a known plaintext attack needing cite paper A sign extension bug in one of the published C C code has been found in cite paper There is no good cryptanalysis on the full round version of Blowfish known publicly till However in Bruce Schneier noted that while Blowfish is still in use he recommended using the new Twofish algorithm instead cite web
