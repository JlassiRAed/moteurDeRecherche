A shuttle is a tool designed to neatly and compactly store weft yarn while weaving Shuttles are thrown or passed back and forth through the shed warp in order to weave in the weft The simplest shuttles known as stick shuttles are made from a flat narrow piece of wood with notches on the ends to hold the weft yarn More complicated shuttles incorporate bobbin s or pirn s Shuttles are often made of wood from the Flowering Dogwood because it is so hard resists splintering and can be polished to a very smooth finish Originally shuttles were passed back and forth by hand However John Kay invented a loom in that incorporated a flying shuttle This shuttle could be thrown through the warp which allowed much wider cloth to be woven much more quickly and made the development of machine looms much simpler and easier to use
