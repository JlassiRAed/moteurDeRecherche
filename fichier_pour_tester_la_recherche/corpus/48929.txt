The cytosol cell and a part of cell metabolism occurs here Protein s within the cytosol play an important role in signal transduction pathways and glycolysis Cytosol mostly consists of water wikt dissolve dissolved ion s small molecule s and large water soluble molecules It contains about to protein Normal human cytosolic pH is whereas the pH of the extracellular fluid is The texture of cytosol being described as granular can be attributed to the fact that in order to study the texture an electron microsope must be used which requires a process of dehydration prior to study
