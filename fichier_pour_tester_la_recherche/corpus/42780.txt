A mechanical wave requires a medium Sound waves waves in a Slinky and pressure waves are all examples of this phenomenon Sound waves need a physical medium in order to exist the Slinky waves need the Slinky and the waves in the ocean need the water Like all waves they have a frequency period wavelength and amplitude Mechanical waves are a local oscillation of material Only the energy propagates the oscillating material does not move far from its initial equilibrium position the wave travels by jumping from one particle of the medium to another Therefore mechanical waves transport energy and not material
