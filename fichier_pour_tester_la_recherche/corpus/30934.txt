The genome of an organism is the whole of its genetics hereditary information code encoded in its DNA This includes both the gene s and the non coding sequences of the DNA The term was coined in by Hans Winkler Professor of Botany at the University of Hamburg Germany as a combination of the words gen e and chromos ome An online copy is available here Winkler s definition in translation runs I propose the expression genome for the haploid chromosome set which together with the pertinent protoplasm specifies the material foundations of the species However no single haploid chromosome set defines even the DNA of a species because of the huge variety of allele s carried by a Population genetics population Even a diploid individual carries genetic variety For that reason Dobzhansky preferred set of chromosomes and the definition now must be broader than Winklers definition The genome of a haploid chromosome set is merely a Sample sample of the total genetic variety of a species The term genome can be applied specifically to mean the complete set of nuclear DNA but can also be used of organelle s that contain their own DNA as with the mitochondria l genome or the chloroplast genome
