A meteor shower is an event when many meteors seem to come from one point in the night sky These meteors are caused by meteoroid s entering Earth s atmosphere at extremely high speeds on parallel paths Most meteors are smaller than a grain of sand so almost all of them burn up and never hit the Earth s surface A meteor shower is the result of an interaction between a planet such as Earth and streams of debris from a comet Comets are dirty snowballs made up of rock embedded in ice orbit ing the Sun Each time a comet swings by the Sun in its orbit some of its ice vaporizes and meteoroids will be shed The meteoroids spread out along the entire orbit of the comet to form a meteoroid stream also known as a dust trail Most of our short period meteor showers are the product of rare disintegrations when large chunks break off a mostly dormant comet Examples are the Quadrantids and Geminids They originated from a breakup of asteroid like objects EH and Phaethon respectively about and years ago The fragments tend to fall apart quickly into dust sand and pebbles and spread out along the orbit of the comet to form a dense meteoroid stream which later moves into Earth s path The most visible meteor shower in most years are the Perseids which peak on August each year at over one meteor per minute NASA has a useful tool to calculate how many meteors per hour are visible from your observing location The Leonids Leonid meteor shower peaks around November of each year About every years the Leonid shower produces a big meteor storm peaking at thousands of meteors per hour Leonid storms gave birth to the term meteor shower when it was first realised during the November storm that the meteors radiated from near the star Gamma Leonis The last Leonid storms were in Before that there were storms in and When the Leonid shower is not storming it is less active than the Perseids
