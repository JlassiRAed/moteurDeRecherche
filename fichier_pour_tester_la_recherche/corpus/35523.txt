A p type semiconductor is a type of semiconductor Ordinary semiconductors are made of materials that do not conduct insulators An electric current occurs when electrons move through a material In order to move there must be an electron hole in the material for the electron to move into A p type semiconductor has more holes than electrons This allows the current to flow along the material from hole to hole but only in one direction Semiconductors are most often made from silicon Silicon is an element with four electrons in its outer shell To make a p type semiconductor extra materials like boron or aluminium are added to the silicon These materials have only three electrons in their outer shell When the extra material replaces some of the silicon it leaves a hole where the fourth electron would have been if the semiconductor was pure silicon
