 Static electricity means the increase of electric charge on the surface of objects This electric charge remains on an object until it either flows into the ground or loses its charge quickly by a discharge Charge exchange can happen in conditions like when different objects are rubbed and separated A static charge will only remain when one of the surfaces has a high resistance to electrical flow The effects of static electricity are familiar to most people because they can see feel and even hear the spark This spark happens when the excess charge is neutralized This neutralization occurs when excess charge flows into an electrical conductor The familiar phenomenon of a static shock is caused by the neutralization of charge
