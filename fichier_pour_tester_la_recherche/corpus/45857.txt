 Linear programming or Linear optimisation is a field of mathematics that deals with finding optimal values or solutions that can be described with linear equations and inequality inequalities Very often this involves finding the minimal or maximal values given some conditions or constraints Linear programming is often used for problems where no exact solution is known for example for planning traffic flows Linear programming is one of the main methods used in Operations research Linear optimization is a special case of Convex optimization It forms the basis for several methods of solving problems of Integer programming In many cases the solutions of linear programs can be mapped to Polyhedron Polyhedra which allows solving and modelling certain problems geometry geometrically In the case of linear programming the word programming should be seen as planning George Dantzig coined the term in the s long before computer s were used to solve such problems Looking at the information theory complexity linear programming problems are simple and can be solved efficiently using algorithm s such as the interior point method In many cases the Simplex algorithm developed by Dantzig has proven to be very fast even though its complexity is exponential in the worst case Leonid Kantorovich developed the first methods of linear programming in
