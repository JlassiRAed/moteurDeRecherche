The origin of birds is one of the most interesting questions in palaeontology and evolution Birds evolved from theropod dinosaurs during the Mesozoic era Thomas Henry Huxley who was a comparative anatomy comparative anatomist made a study of this nearly years ago He compared the first fossil bird Archaeopteryx with a small theropod dinosaur Compsognathus They are two fossils from the same place and time the Solnhofen limestone in Bavaria Germany The strata come from the end of the Jurassic period about million years ago Huxley s papers on Archaeopteryx and the origin of birds were of great interest then and still are He showed that the two fossils were almost identical except for the front limb s and feather s of Archaeopteryx He united reptiles and birds under the title of Sauropsida and thought that birds had evolved from small carnivorous dinosaurs
