The law of large numbers is a theorem from statistics Consider some process in which random outcomes occur For example a random variable is repeatedly observed Then the average of the observed values will be stable in the long run This means that in the long run the average of the observed values will get ever closer to the expected value When rolling dice the numbers and are possible outcomes They are all equally likely The population mean of the outcomes is The following graph shows the results of an experiment of rolls of a die In this experiment it can be seen that the average of die rolls varies wildly at first As predicted by the LLN the average stabilizes around the expected value of as the number of observations become large
