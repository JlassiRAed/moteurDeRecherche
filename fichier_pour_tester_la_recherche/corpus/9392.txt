 Convergent evolution is a process in biology It occurs when two species from unrelated lines develop the same Trait traits or features This happens because they live in similar habitat s and have to develop solutions to the same kind of problems Similarity in traits can occur in two ways Both species might have acquired the trait by descent from a common ancestor In this case the structures are homologous An example is the tetrapod limb which has been inherited from early tetrapods in the late Devonian early Carboniferous about million years ago On the other hand both might be independent adaptation s to similar conditions in their habitat In this case the structures are analogous Convergent evolution leads to analogous features
