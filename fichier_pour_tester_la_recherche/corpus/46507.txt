 Myosins are a group of specialized proteins used for Muscle Muscle contraction muscle contraction and motion in eukaryote eukaryotic cells Myosins need ATP for energy to do these functions A large number of different myosin genes have been discovered in eukaryotes The structure and function of myosin is strongly conserved across species For example Rabbit muscle myosin II will bind to actin from an amoeba
