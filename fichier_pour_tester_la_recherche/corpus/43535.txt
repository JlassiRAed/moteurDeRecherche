A real number is a rational number rational or Number Irrational numbers irrational number Usually when people say number they usually mean real number The official symbol for real numbers is a bold R or a blackboard bold Some real numbers are called positive A positive number is bigger than zero You can think of the real numbers as an infinitely long ruler There is a mark for zero and every other number in order of size Unlike a ruler there are numbers below zero These are called negative real numbers Negative numbers are smaller than zero They are like a mirror image of the positive numbers except they are given minus signs so that they are labeled differently from the positive numbers There are infinitely many real numbers There is no smallest or biggest real number No matter how many real numbers are counted there are always more which need to be counted There are no empty spaces between real numbers This means that if two different real numbers are taken there will always be a third real number between them no matter how close together the first two numbers are If a positive number is added to another positive number that number gets bigger Zero is also a real number If zero is added to a number that number does not change If a negative number is added to another number that number gets smaller The real numbers are countable set uncountable That means that there is no way to put all the real numbers into a sequence Any sequence of real numbers will miss out a real number even if the sequence is infinite This makes the real numbers special Even though there are infinitely many real numbers and infinitely many integers we can say that there are more real numbers than integers because the integers are countable and the real numbers are uncountable Some simpler number systems are inside the real numbers For example the rational number s and integers are all in the real numbers There are also more complicated number systems than the real numbers such as the complex number s Every real number is a complex number but not every complex number is a real number
