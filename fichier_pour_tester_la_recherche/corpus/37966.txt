In chemistry a polar bond is a type of covalent bond between two atoms or more in which electrons are shared unequally A covalent bond is the strong kind of bond that makes something into a molecule Electrons are negatively charged If the two atoms share the electrons equally then the negative charge is evenly spread out over the entire molecule balanced out by the positive charges of the protons in the atoms nuclei This makes the entire molecule neutral a non polar bond making a non polar molecule However if one of the atoms is particularly greedy for electrons then its side of the bond will have more electrons Therefore that side of the bond will have a slightly negative charge and the other side will have a slightly positive charge This is important because it turns the bond into a magnet with two poles Because it acts like a magnet if other bonds that are a lot like magnets are nearby it will react to them When these polar bonds are positioned right the entire molecule can act like a magnet Water does this You can see in the image below that the hydrogen is negatively charged This picture shows how the little water magnets line up with each other in the same way that if you toss a bunch of little magnets into a box they ll line up with each other File D model hydrogen bonds in water svgThis is one of the most basic and important differences between bonds and it creates an enormous difference in how the molecules behave
