A substitution cipher is a form of cryptography In a substitution cipher a rule is used to change each letter of the message one at a time The rule says to replace each letter with another letter from the alphabet For instance this table gives a rule for a substitution cipher Using this rule the sentence Jack and Jill went up the hill is changed to Etar tzn Evmm gkzc dw cuk uvmm The Caesar cipher is one example of a substitution cipher Substitution ciphers are not safe enough to use for important messages Substitution ciphers can be broken by an idea called frequency analysis Some letters are more common than others in English sentences E is the most common then T then A and so on A message that has been changed by a substitution cipher will have different common letters but this gives a hint about the rule The most common letters in the changed message are likely to be the most common letters in English Breaking cryptograms is a common puzzle often found in newspapers
