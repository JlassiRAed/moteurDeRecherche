 Adapiforms are an extinct group of early primate s Adapiforms adaptive radiation radiated throughout much of the northern continental mass reaching as far south as northern Africa and tropical Asia They lived from the Eocene to the Miocene epochs Some adapiforms looked similar to living lemur s Adapiforms are known from the fossil record only and it is unclear whether they form a monophyletic or paraphyletic group When assumed to be a clade they are usually grouped under the wet nosed taxon Strepsirrhini which would make them more closely related to the lemurs and less so to the dry nosed Haplorhini taxon that includes monkey s and ape s In Franzen and colleagues put the newly described genus Darwinius as a stem missing link between Strepsirrhini and Haplorhini
