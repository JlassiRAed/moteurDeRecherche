The Kingdom of God or Kingdom of Heaven is an important religious idea It is found in Judaism Christianity and Islam God has a Kingdom of His own The Parables of Jesus talk about the Kingdom Life here is seen as a test for us and if we follow the orders of God and do good deeds then we shall be rewarded in an Afterlife where good people alone will enter the heaven with all its joys Those who do evil will not get to heaven
