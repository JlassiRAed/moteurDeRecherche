 Solid s mostly This response to temperature change is expressed as its coefficient of thermal expansion The coefficient of thermal expansion is used in linear thermal expansion in area thermal expansion in volume tric thermal expansionThese characteristics are closely related The volumetric thermal expansion coefficient can be measured for all substances of condensed matter The linear thermal expansion can only be measured in the solid state and is common in engineering applications
