A ligand is a biochemical substance Its function is to bind to a biological molecule and make the molecule perform a function Ligand binding alters the shape of the receptor protein This changes the protein s behaviour In a narrower sense it is a Signal transduction signal triggering molecule binding to a site on a target protein The binding occurs by intermolecular force s such as ionic bond s hydrogen bond s and van der Waals forces The docking Ligands include Substrate substrate s inhibitor s activator s and neurotransmitter s The tendency or strength of binding is called Receptor ligand binding affinity affinity
