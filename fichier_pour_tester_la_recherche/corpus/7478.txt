 as a compromise between election of the president by Congress and election by popular vote Originally electors voted for two candidates and the people with the two highest vote totals would be elected President and Vice President That did not work very well so today the President and Vice President are elected on separate ballots In order to win in the Electoral College a candidate needs votes If there is no winner in the Electoral College the House of Representatives elects the President and the Senate elects the Vice President
