A line item veto is the power of the president without rejecting the whole thing In the United States almost all governor s are able to use the line item veto Currently the President of the United States is not able to use the line item veto President Bill Clinton was given the line item veto by the United States Congress for a few years until the Supreme Court of the United States Supreme Court said that it was unconstitutional People who like the line item veto say that it is good because it allows the President to remove unimportant waste from important legislation For example it would be too dangerous to completely veto big pieces of legislation but with the line item veto the President could choose to keep what he or she thinks are the good parts of the bill and reject the bad parts of the bill People who do not like the line item veto say that it is bad because it gives the President too much power over Congress and believe that it goes against the checks and balances created by the United States Constitution U S Constitution Other criticisms include the possibility that the president s individual vetoes of line items make the bill different than what Congress voted for
