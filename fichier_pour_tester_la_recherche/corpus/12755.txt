 Colossus was the world s first Computer programming programmable electronics electronic digital computer British codebreakers used Colossus to help to read Nazi Germany German Encryption coded radio messages during World War II These messages were sent between the German High Command and Adolf Hitler s top Wehrmacht army commanders Reading these messages helped the Allies of World War II Allies to win the war Codebreaker Max Newman worked at the Government Communications Headquarters Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park His problem was how to get a machine that would help turn German coded radio teleprinter messages into ordinary language A group of Post Office telephone engineers led by Tommy Flowers worked out how to do this Colossus Mark was even better It first worked on June just before the Operation Overlord Normandy Landings on D Day Ten Colossus computers were in use at the end of the war British codebreakers called the teleprinter messages Fish The messages had been coded by an unknown German machine They called the machine and its coded messages Tunny Colossus imitated the machine and read the coded message from a punched tape It tried various possibilities of how two of the wheels had been set up When Colossus found likely settings for two wheels the codebreaker designed further programs for Colossus until likely settings of other wheels were found Colossus did not perform all of the decoding process It just found likely settings of the machine The output from Colossus was then worked on by people who had a very good knowledge of the German language It was not until the end of the war that the British codebreakers found out that the code machine was the Lorenz SZ After the war all the secret Colossus computers were taken to pieces so that no one would find out about them The designs were destroyed For thirty years no one knew who made the first computers Between the early s and a working copy of a Colossus computer was built This can be seen at The National Museum of Computing at Bletchley Park in England
