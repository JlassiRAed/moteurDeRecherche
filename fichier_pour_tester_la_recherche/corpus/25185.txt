 Hydrogen halides are inorganic compound s that contain a hydrogen ion and a halide ion The halogen s are fluorine chlorine bromine and iodine Astatine does not make a stable hydrogen halide so it is not included The hydrogen halides are diatomic molecules with no tendency to ionize in the gas phase Chemists therefore distinguish hydrogen chloride from hydrochloric acid The former is a gas at room temperature that reacts with water to give the acid Once the acid has formed the diatomic molecule can not easily be regenerated
