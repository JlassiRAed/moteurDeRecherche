 Exclusive disjunction is a Logic operation on two value s It will be true if exactly one of the two values is true Otherwise it will be false This also means that the result of XOR will be true only if both the values are different Same values will result in a false The best way to remember a XOR operation is One or the other but not both This is wikt difference different from inclusive disjunction
