In computer science a closure is a function that has an environment of its own Inside this environment there is at least one bound variable Closures were first used in programming language s such as ML and Lisp When a closure is used more than once the bound variables stay the same in between anonymous function Anonymous functions are sometimes wrongly called closures This is probably because most languages that have anonymous functions also have closures and it s common for programmers to learn about both at the same time Closures and anonymous functions are similar but have important differences Computer scientists worked out how closures should work in the s and programmers were first able to use them in the Scheme Scheme programming language Since then many languages have been designed to support closures Function object s are sometimes also called closures
