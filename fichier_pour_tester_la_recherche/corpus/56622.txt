A coefficient of friction is a value that shows the relationship between the force of friction between two objects and the normal reaction between the objects It is a value that is sometimes used in physics to find an object s normal force or frictional force when other methods aren t available The coefficient of friction is shown by is the normal force The coefficient The coefficient of static friction is the friction force between two objects when neither of the objects is moving The coefficient of kinetic friction is the force between two objects when one object is moving or if two objects are moving against each other The coefficient of friction is dimensionless quantity dimensionless meaning it does not have any unit s It is a scalar meaning the direction of the force does not affect the physical quantity The coefficient of friction depends on the objects that are causing friction The value is usually between and but can be greater than A value of means there is no friction at all between the objects This is only theoretical physics theoretically possible All objects in the real world will have some friction when they touch each other A value of means the frictional force is equal to the normal force Some people think that the coefficient of friction can never be more than but this is not true A coefficient of friction that is more than one just means that friction is stronger than the normal force An object such as silicone rubber for example can have a coefficient of friction much greater than one The coefficient of friction can also be changed by the mass and speed of the moving object The friction force is the force exerted by a surface when an object moves across it or makes an effort to move across it The frictional force or force of friction can be expressed as where is the frictional force is the static and is the normal force
