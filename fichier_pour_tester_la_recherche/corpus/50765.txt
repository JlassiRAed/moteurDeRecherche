There is an antiparticle corresponding to most kinds of particle physics particle It has the same mass and opposite electric charge Even electrically neutral particles such as the neutron are not identical to their antiparticle In the example of the neutron the ordinary particle is made out of quarks and the antiparticle out of antiquarks Particle antiparticle pairs can Antimatter Annihilation annihilate each other if they are in appropriate quantum state s They can also be produced in various processes These processes are used in particle accelerator s to create new particles and to test theories of particle physics High energy processes in nature can create antiparticles These are visible in cosmic ray s and in certain nuclear reaction s The word antimatter properly refers to and to larger assemblies of either
