 Nuclear fission is a nuclear reaction nuclear process It is when an atom splits apart into smaller atoms The process gives off a lot of energy and is used in nuclear weapon s and nuclear reactor s Nuclear fission was discovered in December by the German nuclear chemist Otto Hahn and his assistant Fritz Strassmann in Berlin An atom is the smallest particle which makes up a chemical element nucleus is at the center of every atom Elements which have large nuclei such as uranium and plutonium can be made to fission If a it releases a lot of energy and it also causes some neutrons to be released For a few isotope s one such fission can release many neutrons If those neutrons then hit other atoms they will make the other atoms split This can happen again and again This is called a nuclear chain reaction and it can release huge amounts of energy very quickly The amount of energy released by a nuclear chain reaction is measured in kilotons One kiloton is the same as the energy of one thousand tons of Trinitrotoluene TNT In a nuclear bomb this must happen very quickly to make a very big explosion In a nuclear reactor this must happen slowly to make heat The heat is used to boil water into steam which turns a turbine to generate electricity
