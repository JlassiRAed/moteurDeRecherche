 Permeability is a property of a material that describes how density dense a magnetism magnetic field would be if the same amount of electric current current was passed through it Permeability is measured in henries per metre and its symbol is Since vacuum empty space has a constant permeability Some materials have been specially designed to have a permeability one million times larger than empty space
