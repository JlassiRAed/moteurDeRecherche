 Spherical geometry is the use of geometry on a sphere It was started for cartography as well as for making maps of stars It is different from Euclidean geometry Points are defined in the same way as they are in Euclidean geometry A point is at a defined location on the sphere A staight line is different though It is the shortest path between two points which stays on the surface of the plane Some theorems of Euclidean geometry cannot be used on the sphere many of them have been adapted though
