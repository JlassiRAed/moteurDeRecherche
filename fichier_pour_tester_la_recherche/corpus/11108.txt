 Wave power means the use of ocean surface wave s and the capture of that energy to do useful Work It makes use of the kinetic energy of the waves that are driven by the wind Power from ocean surface wave motion might produce much more energy than tide s Tests have shown that it is possible to produce energy from waves particularly in Scotland in the UK But the technology is not as well developed as other renewable energy such as wind power or solar power
