The Bayreuth Festspielhaus is an opera house in the town of Bayreuth Germany The German opera composer Richard Wagner got the opera house built so that his own music could be performed properly He had lots of ideas about how opera should be performed and he thought that there was no opera house in Germany that was good enough for performances of his operas Today it is still the place where every year there is a festival the Bayreuth Festival which is dedicated only to the operas of Richard Wagner Ludwig II of Bavaria King Ludwig II of Bavaria was a great admirer of Richard Wagner and he gave a lot of money for the opera house to be built Wagner watched the construction all the time and made sure that everything was built in the way he wanted Work on the building started on May were performed The opera house is big enough for an audience of One unusual thing is the orchestra pit which is right under the stage covered by a hood so that the orchestra cannot be seen at all by the audience Wagner wanted the audience to be able to concentrate properly on the action on the Stage stage instead of being distracted by watching the orchestra It makes it very difficult for the orchestra and the singers to be together and conductors have to get used to the problem The Festspielhaus also has a double proscenium which makes it look as if the stage is farther away than it actually is
