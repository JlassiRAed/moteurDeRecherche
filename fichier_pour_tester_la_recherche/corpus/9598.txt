A graduate school is a student who goes to the school Also in British English the phrase postgraduate student is more common Usually students must have an undergraduate degree before beginning graduate school Many university universities give graduate degrees A graduate school is not always a separate school The term graduate school could be confusing because the verb graduate is also used to mean completing high school education or a bachelor s degree The verb infinitive to graduate is used for all those types of schools but the meaning of the adjective graduate is changed to mean postgraduate in the term graduate school The small change in meaning can be viewed with an air of sophistication where experienced students are often more aware of the issue while novice students might not be aware as being more naive
