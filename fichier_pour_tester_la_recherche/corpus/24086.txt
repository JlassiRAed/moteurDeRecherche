 multiple image Equation s that describe wave s as they occur in nature are called wave equations Waves as they occur in river s lake s and ocean s are similar to those of sound and light The problem of having to describe waves arises in fields like acoustics electromagnetism electromagnetics and fluid dynamics Historically the problem of a vibrating string such as that of a musical instrument was studied by Jean le Rond d Alembert Leonhard Euler Daniel Bernoulli and Joseph Louis Lagrange
