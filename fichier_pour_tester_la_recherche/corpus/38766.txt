 Gesso is a primer or foundation for art painting on wood or canvas It is a white paint mixture It has a binder mixed with a pigment Traditionally the binder is glue or gelatin the pigment is chalk plaster or gypsum Thompson Daniel Varney The materials and techniques of medieval painting p Gesso is used in art to prepare a surfaces for painting Paint and or other materials are applied on top of the gesso One reason for covering the surface with gesso is that wood or canvas has a rough or uneven surface and a colour Gesso priming lets the artist s chosen subject show more clearly than it would otherwise Even if a surface has no roughness many artists still prime it before starting the painting proper though they might use a paint or wash of their own choosing They do this because the primer though it cannot be seen directly may change and help the quality of light reflected from the surface Gesso however is specially useful for a rough or uneven surface
