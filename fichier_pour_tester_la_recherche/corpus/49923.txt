A synchronous orbit is an orbit in which an orbiting body Or in smaller words the orbit above and the spinning planet below go around once in the same amount of time It orbits in the same direction of rotation as that body So if you were on the orbiting body you would always see the same side of the body being orbited Or if you were on the body being orbited the orbiting body would stay in the same part of the sky
