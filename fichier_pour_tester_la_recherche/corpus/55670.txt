A False analogy is an informal fallacy It applies to induction inductive arguments It is an informal fallacy because the error is about what the argument is about and not the argument itself An analogy proposes that two concept s which are similar have a common relationship to some property A has property X therefore B must also have property X In a false analogy the objects may have some similarities but they do not both have property X That way both objects may have the same color but this does not mean that they have the same size Even if banana s and the sun appear yellow one could not conclude that they are the same size One who makes an invalid analogy or comparison is often said to be apples and oranges comparing apples and oranges
