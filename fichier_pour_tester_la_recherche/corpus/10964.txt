 Hamiltonian mechanics is a mathematical way of understanding the way something mechanical will behave It was invented in by Irish mathematician William Rowan Hamilton The value of the Hamiltonian is the total energy of the thing being described For a closed system it is the sum of its kinetic energy kinetic and potential energy There will be a set of differential equation s known as the Hamilton equations which show how the thing changes through time Hamiltonians can be used to describe such simple systems as a bouncing ball a pendulum or an oscillating spring in which energy changes between kinetic and potential energy and back again over time Hamiltonians can also be used to study the orbits of planets and in the behaviour of atoms using the principles of quantum mechanics
