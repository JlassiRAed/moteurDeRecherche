 Toroid Toroidal inductor s and transformer s are a kind of electronic component They typically consist of a circular ring shaped magnet ic centre The magnet is usually considered a monopole although the central axis will have a dipole and have the advantage of being wound continuously in a single direction thus there is no inductive interference between windings as in a solenoid that is wound back and forth
