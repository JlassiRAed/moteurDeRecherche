A carbonyl is the group C O in a molecule It is a carbon and an oxygen atom with a double bond between them Carbon has another two bonds which can in general be with any other group For example a carbonyl is the C O bit of a ketone aldehyde or ester Because oxygen is more electronegative than carbon the electrons in the bond are more towards it This means that in acid a proton will go on the oxygen atom Both the carbon and the oxygen in the group are sp Orbital hybridization hybridized The carbonyl is a very important functional group because chemists can do many chemical reaction reactions with it It is easy to do nucleophilic addition s to it which makes the molecule bigger It is also easy to do redox reactions for example forming an alcohol The alcohol then is also a very useful group Carbonyls are found in many natural substances and also in drug s and medicines It is easy to check if a carbonyl is in a molecule It gives a very strong signal in infrared spectroscopy In carbon NMR spectroscopy the signal is usually at very high frequency away from many other peaks
