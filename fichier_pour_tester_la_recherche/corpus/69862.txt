 RR Lyrae is a pulsating variable star in the constellation Lyra It is the model for the variable stars known as RR Lyrae variables It pulses over a short cycle of hours minutes Kolenberg K et al An in depth spectroscopic analysis of the Blazhko star RR Lyrae I Characterisation of the star abundance analysis and fundamental parameters Astronomy and Astrophysics A Stars of this type are often found in globular clusters and used as standard candle s to measure distances to other galaxies RR Lyrae and its type are pulsating stars of spectral classification spectral class A with a mass of around half the Sun s It is thought they previously shed mass and consequently they were once stars with similar or slightly less mass than the Sun about solar masses RR Lyrae stars pulse in a manner similar to Cepheid variable s so the mechanism for the pulsation is thought to be similar The nature and histories of these stars is thought to be rather different Unlike Cepheids RR Lyraes are old low mass metal poor Population II stars They are much more common than Cepheids but also much less luminous The average absolute magnitude of an RR Lyrae is about only or times brighter than our Sun Their period is shorter typically less than one day sometimes ranging down to seven hours The relationship between pulsation period and absolute magnitude of RR Lyraes makes them good standard candles for relatively near objects especially within the Milky Way They are extensively used in globular cluster studies and also used to study chemical properties of older stars Knowing the period luminosity relation for local RR Lyrae type variable stars allows the distance of more distant stars of this type to be determined The distance of RR Lyrae remained uncertain until when the Hubble Space Telescope was used to fix its distance within a margin of error The result was
