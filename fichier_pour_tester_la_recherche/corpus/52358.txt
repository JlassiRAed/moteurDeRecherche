 Direct current The direct current always flow in the same direction distinguishing it from the alternating current Direct current used to be called Galvanic current Batteries are some of the main sources of direct current but many other sources also exist such as bridge rectifier s in power supply solar panels etc Typically the current goes through a Electrical conductor conductor and other things that can carry DC DC is also sent through a vacuum as in Cathode ray electron beam s or ion beams The first commercial electric power transmission was developed by Thomas Edison in the late th century nineteenth century using direct current Today nearly all electric power distribution uses alternating current because of the advantages with transformers and transmission High voltage direct current is often used for transporting electricity to places far away For applications requiring direct current the alternating current is typically distributed to a substation and then converted to direct current Long after the usage of direct current had been established physicists realized that the current was made of negative electric charge s the electrons and that the actual flow was from the negative to the positive pole but by convention the usage of the term was never changed
