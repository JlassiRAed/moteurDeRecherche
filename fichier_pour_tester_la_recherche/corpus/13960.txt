 Marie Jean Pierre Flourens proved that the effects of the mind were caused by the brain not the heart He was a French physiologist the founder of experimental brain science and a pioneer in anesthesia He use brain surgery on animals and studied their effects His kind of surgery is called ablative surgery in most cases ablative brain surgery does not mean removing brain tissue but rather destroying tissue and leaving it in place In Flourens pioneered the experimental method of ablating parts of the brain in living rabbits and pigeons He carefully observed their effects His intention was to find out whether different parts of the brain had different functions Flourens was able to show for the first time that the main parts of the brain were responsible for largely different functions By removing the cerebral hemisphere s for instance all perception s voluntary action and judgment were abolished The removal of the cerebellum affected the animal s equilibrium and motor coordination while the destruction of the brainstem caused death These experiments led Flourens to conclude that
