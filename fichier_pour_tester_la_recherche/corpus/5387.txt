The human skeleton is the wikt internal internal framework of the body It is made up of about bone s at birth As some bones join together there are bones in adulthood The bones are at their stongest around age The human skeleton can be divided into the axial skeleton and the appendicular skeleton The axial skeleton is formed by the vertebral column the rib cage the skull and other associated bones The appendicular skeleton which is attached to the axial skeleton is formed by the shoulder girdle the pelvic girdle and the bones of the upper and lower limb s The human skeleton performs six major functions These are support movement protection production of blood cells storage of wikt mineral mineral s and endocrine regulation The male and female skeletons are not so Sexual dimorphism different as those of many other primate s There are subtle differences between sex es in the Morphology morphology of the skull teeth long bone s and pelvis In general female skeletal elements tend to be smaller and less robust than corresponding male elements The human female pelvis is different from that of males in order to facilitate child birth The hips on a female are proportionately wider than males and so the ball joints at the top of the legs are set more apart than in males This and the pelvic shape gives a birth channel which allows the newborn foetus to pass through The critical factor is the baby s head which is much larger than in other primates Unlike most primates human males do not have penile bone s This is an adaptation to the human bipedalism upright stance
