 Pietro Cavallini The fresco at Santa Cecilia s is a large picture of the Last Judgement with Jesus sitting between rows of saint s Unfortunately the room which was quite tall had a new level added and the floor cut across the fresco It is in ruins but the parts that remain show that Cavallini was trying to make the figures that he painted look solid and three dimensional like the frescos of Ancient Rome Pietro Cavallini probably influenced the artists who travelled from Rome to work at the Basilica of St Francis of Assisi It is not known if he painted any of the frescos there
