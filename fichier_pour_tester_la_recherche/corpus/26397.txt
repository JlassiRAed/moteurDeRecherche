A shape is a geometry geometric wikt figure figure that can be described with mathematics One way to classify shapes is to describe a bigger kind of shape that the shape is one of For example they can be classified by their different numbers of dimension s Thus circle s are two dimensional shapes so like other D shapes they will fit into a flat Plane plane Three dimensional objects like cubes will not fit inside a plane because they are not flat D Four dimensional shapes made of polygon s are called polychoron s and shapes made of polygons of any dimension are polytope s Two shapes are said to be equal if one can be changed into the other by rotation turning moving growing shrinking or more than one of these in combination
