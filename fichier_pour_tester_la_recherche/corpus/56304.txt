 Xenon is a non metal chemical element It has the chemical symbol Xe and atomic number It is one of the few elements that are a gas at Standard temperature and pressure Sir William Ramsay and M W Travers discovered this element in The element s name came from the Greek language Greek word xenos which means stranger Xenon belongs to the group of the noble gas es Noble gases are very unreactive However in chemists have found that xenon can react with fluorine under special conditions such as high pressure and high temperature It is not known why xenon behaves differently under these circumstances There are also some compounds with oxygen The gas is not very reactive because if fulfills the octet rule This means that a lot of energy is needed to remove an electron from xenon This activation energy for xenon is Joule kJ mol To remove a second electron from xenon an energy of kJ mol is needed Known oxidation states of xenon are and However the most stable form is pure xenon or the xenon s oxidation state of Xenon has stable isotope s and more than unstable isotopes Xenon gas is used in electron tube s bactericidal lamp s strobe lamp s and lamps used to excite ruby lasers
