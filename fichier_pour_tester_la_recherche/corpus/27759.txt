 Ground sloths are a group of extinct large sloth s in the mammal ian superorder Xenarthra The term ground sloth is used as opposed to the much smaller living tree sloths Their most recent survivor s lived in the Caribbean Antilles where they may have survived until about and BC This was the last known occurrence of Megalocnus in Cuba Most ground sloth evolution took place during the mid to late Tertiary of South America while the continent was isolated At their earliest appearance in the fossil record the ground sloths were already distinct at the family level The presence of intervening islands between the American continents in the Miocene allowed a dispersal of forms into North America A number of mid to small sized forms are believed to have previously dispersed to the Antilles islands either by making short swims or using land bridges Ground sloths were a hardy group their numbers and dispersals into remote areas are evidence of this Remains have been found in Patagonia Hogan C M Cueva del Milodon Megalithic Portal Retrieved APR and parts of Alaska Sloths and xenarthrans as a whole were one of the more successful South American groups during the Great American Interchange Great American Biotic Interchange In general during the interchange many more taxa moved from North America into South America than in the other direction However at least five genera of ground sloths have been identified in North American fossils these are examples of successful migration to the north
