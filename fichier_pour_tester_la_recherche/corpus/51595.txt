 Ocean trenches have relatively steep sides falling to the ocean floor Ocean trenches are typically caused when an continental plate oceanic crustal plate slides under a lighter continental plate or another oceanic plate It is believed to work by density Where one plate tectonics plate slides under another this is called subduction As the heavier plate descends the long narrow feature caused is called the subduction zone It is here that oceanic trenches form They can be miles wide At least five trenches are over miles deep The greatest ocean depth to be sounded is in the Challenger Deep of the Mariana Trench at a depth of Trenches are active with earthquake s and resulting tsunami s Most volcanism associated with trenches occurs on the continent and not on the sea floor However many of the ocean s volcanic islands and seamounts are found in what are called island arc s bending chains of island s rising from the sea floor usually paralleling the concave edges of an oceanic trench The western Pacific has island arcism as do the Aleutian Islands Near the island of Guam is the famous Mariana Trench where the Pacific Plate descends under the leading edge of the Eurasia n Plate Measured at feet over miles deep this trench is the deepest known spot in any ocean In two men in the bathyscaph Trieste reached bottom of the Mariana Trench Other extensive trench regions around the world include the South Sandwich Trench between South America and Antarctica the Peru Chile Trench and the Aleutian Islands Aleutian Trench
