 Brachiopods are a phylum of small Ocean marine shellfish sometimes called lampshells They are not common today but in the Palaeozoic they were one of the most common types They lived near the shore but now they have been pushed into deeper water by competition from bivalve mollusc s At their peak in the Palaeozoic era the brachiopods occupied a number of marine ecological niche s They were among the most abundant filter feeders and reef builders Many sat on the sea floor but some swam in the jet propulsion style of scallop s Brachiopod fossils have been useful indicators of climate change s during the Paleozoic era They do look rather like bivalves but their internal organisation is quite different Their mostly calcium carbonate shells or valves have upper and lower surfaces unlike the left and right arrangement in bivalve molluscs Brachiopod valves are hinge d at the rear end The front can be opened for feeding or closed for protection Two major groups are recognized articulate and inarticulate Articulate brachiopods have toothed hinges and simple opening and closing muscles while inarticulate brachiopods have untoothed hinges and a more complex system of muscles used to fit the two halves together In a typical brachiopod a stalk like pedicle goes from an opening in one of the valves It attaches the animal to the seabed but clear of silt that would obstruct the opening Brachiopods have a huge fossil record going back to the Cambrian They were much reduced by the two main extinction events the P Tr extinction event P Tr and K T extinction event K T Bivalve molluscs took over their inshore habitats in the Mesozoic and since then the brachiopods have been confined to deeper water except for a handful of species There are about to species living the fossil species number Lingula one of the oldest genera of brachiopods has survived from the earliest Ordovician to the present day The various species look very similar and the genus is a good example of a living fossil Brachiopod classification is being debated by invertebrate palaeontologists
