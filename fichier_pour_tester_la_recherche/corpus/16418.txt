 Peat swamp forests are forest wetlands in tropical and subtropical areas They have poor drainage and waterlogged soil prevents dead leaves and wood from fully decomposing Over time this creates a thick layer of acidic peat They are made up of trees which are broadleaved and many other types of flowering plants Peat swamp forests are usually surrounded by lowland rain forests on better drained soils and by brackish or salt water mangrove mangrove forests near the coast These tropical swamp forests are quite different to the north temperate peat bogs in climates such as in Ireland Temperate peat bogs are not caused by forests but mostly by mosses such as Sphagnum grasses sedges and shrubs
