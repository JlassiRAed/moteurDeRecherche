A nitro compound is a molecule that has the nitro functional group group The nitro group is made of one nitrogen atom connected with two oxygen atoms The nitrogen is also chemical bond bonded to the rest of the molecule Nitrogen normally has only three bonds In a nitro group it is considered positively charged Then one of the oxygen is negatively charged and the other has a double bond In reality the best way to represent the nitro group is to consider it to have delocalisation delocalized electrons Then all three atoms are sp Orbital hybridisation hybridised Nitro compounds are very explosive This is because at high temperature they can decompose and release nitrogen gas This chemical reaction reaction is very exothermic
