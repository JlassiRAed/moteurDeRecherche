A decomposer is an organism that breaks down long chain polymer s from dead organisms into smaller molecules Decomposers are bacteria and fungi What they do is use the parts and energy to build up their own materials which are also organic Decomposers are heterotroph s This means they use organic organic substrates to get their energy carbon and nutrients for growth and development Decomposers break down cells of other organisms using biochemical reactions without need for internal digestion This is different from detritivore s which actually digest dead organic matter Decomposition also involves abiotic decomposition This is breakdown by chemical processes such as hydrolysis or physical processes such as heat This turns organic material into inorganic material and so returns nutrients to the environment
