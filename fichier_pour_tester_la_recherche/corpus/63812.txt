 Biofuel is fuel from recently lifeless or living biological material It is different to fossil fuels from long dead biological material Biofuel can be in forms of solid liquid or gas Biofuels are usually used to power cars heat homes and for cooking Biofuel companies are mainly from Europe Asia and the Americas Technologies developed at the Los Alamos National Lab even allows pollution to be converted into renewable biofuel Agrofuels are biofuels that are produced from Monoculture specific plants rather than from waste processes such as landfill or recycled material There are two common ways to convert plants into gas and liquid fuels One is to grow crops that are high in sugar The second is to grow plants that contain high amounts of vegetable oil such as palm oil soybean and algae When these oils are heated their viscosity is reduced and they can be burned directly in a diesel engine or they can be chemically processed to produce fuels such as biodiesel Wood and its by products can also be converted into biofuels such as charcoal woodgas methanol or ethanol fuel It is also possible to make cellulosic ethanol from non edible plant parts but this can be expensive Solid biomass is also used Firewood has been used for thousands of years Many materials such as wood and grasses can be dried and pelletised and burnt and this can be used to produce power
