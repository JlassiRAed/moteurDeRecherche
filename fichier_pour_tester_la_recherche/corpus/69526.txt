 Thermochemistry is the study of the energy and heat to do with chemical reaction s and physical transformations A reaction gives out or takes in energy A physical transformation also gives out or takes in energy Thermochemistry looks at these energy changes particularly on a system s energy exchange with its surroundings Thermochemistry is useful in predict predicting reactant and product quantities at all times during a given reaction Thermochemists do this by using data including entropy determinations Thermochemists will tell if a reaction is Spontaneous process spontaneous or non spontaneous favorable or unfavorable Endothermic reaction s take in heat Exothermic reaction s give out heat Thermochemistry combines the concepts of thermodynamics with the idea of energy in the form of chemical bond s It includes calculations of such quantities as heat capacity heat of combustion heat of formation enthalpy entropy thermodynamic potential free energy and calorie s
