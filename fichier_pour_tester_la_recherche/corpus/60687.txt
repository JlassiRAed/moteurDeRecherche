A family name is a name shared by people in the same family Different culture s have different orders for a person s family name and given name In English the family name is always at the end so it is also called a last name or surname Children usually have the same family name as their father A married woman often changes her family name to be the same as her husband For example Mary Brown married John Smith and she changed her name to Mary Smith They had two children David Smith and Kate Smith Smith is the family name shared by the parents Mary and John and their children David and Kate But if David Smith died without having any children and Kate married and changed her last name then the last name would have gone from the male line so it has died out Many languages put the family name first Some give a child the mother s family name Some use more complex names that list the family name of both parent s and sometimes additional family relations Some such as Javanese language Javanese do not very often give anyone a family name
