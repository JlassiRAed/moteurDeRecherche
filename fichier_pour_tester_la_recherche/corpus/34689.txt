A digital signal processor is a specialized microprocessor design ed specifically for digital signal processing generally used in real time computing Digital signal processing algorithm s require a large number of Mathematics mathematical operations to be performed quickly on a set of data Signals are converted from Analog to digital converter analog to digital manipulated digitally and then converted again to form Digital to analog converter digital to analog as shown in the diagram Many digital signal processing applications have Real time computing real time constraints that is for the system to work the DSP operation must be completed within some time constraint The microarchitecture of a digital signal processor is optimized specifically for digital signal processing applications
