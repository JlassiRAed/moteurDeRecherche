In organic chemistry an alkene olefin or olefine is an Saturation unsaturated chemical compound containing at least one carbon to carbon double bond Aromaticity Aromatic compounds are often drawn as cyclic alkenes but their structure and properties are different and they are not considered to be alkenes The double bond in the middle makes them more reactive because the molecule is not saturated An alkene s unsaturation means that it will take the color out of bromine The names of alkenes always end with ene
