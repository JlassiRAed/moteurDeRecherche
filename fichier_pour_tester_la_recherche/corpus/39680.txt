 Numerical weather prediction is the way weather forecast s are made This is done using computer model s of the atmosphere Such models describe the current weather conditions and how they change over time using equation s Using the current weather conditions the equations can be solved or approximated to tell what the weather will be like in the near future The relevant physical parameters such as pressure temperature the direction and the speed of the wind are taken to be function s of time These are modelled with a system of partial differential equation s This is a dynamic system that is solved number numerically Most of these equations are implemented using FORTRAN The equations are approximated Since this takes a lot of computing power or time supercomputer s are used for this task most of the time
