The activation energy of a chemical reaction is the minimum energy that is needed to make the reaction happen It usually has the symbol E and it is measured in kilojoule per mole It can be thought of as a barrier between the reagents and the products of a reaction The activation energy is the difference in energy between the transition state and the starting reagents
