A comet is a sphere ball of mostly ice that moves around in outer space Comets are often described as dirty snowballs They are very different from asteroid s The orbital inclination s of comets are usually high and not near the ecliptic where most solar system objects are found Most of them are long period comets and come from the Kuiper belt That is very far away from the Sun but some of them also come near enough to Earth for us to see at wikt night night They have long tails because the Sun melt s the ice A comet s tail does not trail behind it but points directly away from the Sun because it is blown by the solar wind The hard centre of the comet is the comet nucleus nucleus It is one of the blackest things in the solar system When light shone on the nucleus of Halley s Comet the comet reflected only of the light back to us Periodic comets Periodic comets visit again and again Non periodic or single apparition comets visit only once Comets sometimes break up as Comet Biela did in the th century Comet Shoemaker Levy broke up and the pieces hit Jupiter together in groups Astronomer s think these comets are broken pieces that used to be one object
