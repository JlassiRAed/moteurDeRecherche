In physics force is a push or a pull that changes or tends to change the state of rest or uniform motion of an object or changes the direction or shape of an object Force causes objects to acceleration accelerate add to the object s overall pressure torque change direction or Deformation change shape Force is measured in Newtons A force is always a push pull or a twist and it affects objects by pushing them up pulling them down pushing them to a side or by changing their motion or shape in some other way
