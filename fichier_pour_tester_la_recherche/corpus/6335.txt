In electricity electronics doping is the process of adding certain chemical element s to a semiconductor in order to change its electrical properties These elements are tiny Impurity impurities This is done to create diode s that make electricity go in one direction or to make transistor s and semiconductor switches When an element called boron is added to silicon the boron dopant is called an acceptor because it likes accepting electrons When a chemical called phosphorous is added to silicon the phosphorous is called a donor because it does not like electrons chemistry stub
