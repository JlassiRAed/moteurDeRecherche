 Lamarckism is an hypothesis regarding evolution Evolution tries to explain how species change over time Today the only widely accepted theory of evolution is that developed from the ideas of Charles Darwin Lamarckism was developed by Jean Baptiste de Lamarck He based his ideas to some extent on those of Erasmus Darwin the grandfather of Charles Darwin Lamarckism says that individuals do not only pass on the things they received from their parents but also some things they experienced during their lifetime As an example he cited giraffe s Giraffes which have long neck s must have evolved from ancestors with much shorter necks His idea was that adults needed to stretch their neck to reach leaves from high branches Therefore he thought the children inherited longer necks This idea is called the inheritance of acquired characteristics Although Darwin did not entirely break with these ideas his characteristic idea of natural selection relates to the individuals s relative survival and success in reproduction Better adaptation adapted forms leave on average more offspring This changes the proportion of allele s in the population Gregor Mendel discovered some basic rules of heredity These rules of Mendelian inheritance contradict Lamarck s hypotheses entirely but are consistent with natural selection This explains why Lamarck s ideas are no longer regarded as a sound explanation of evolution Where Lamarck and Darwin do agree is that evolution did take place
