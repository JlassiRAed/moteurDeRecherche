 Small nuclear RNA joins with protein s to form spliceosome s The spiceosomes govern alternative splicing The background to this is that in eukaryote s most gene s code for a protein in separated strings of DNA This is because of a total gene coding bits The process called alternative splicing can produce many possible proteins from the gene parts because the proteins are put together in different ways Alternative splicing produces alternative messenger RNA s and these produce different proteins Spliceosomes control the details of the splicing The two essential components of snRNPs are protein molecules and RNA The RNA found within each snRNP particle is known as small nuclear RNA or snRNA and is usually about nucleotide s in length The snRNA component of the snurp is specific to individual introns because it recognises the sequences of critical signals at the ends and branch sites of introns The snRNA in snurps is similar to ribosomal RNA it acts both as an enzyme and builds structure SnRNPs were discovered by Michael Lerner and Joan Steitz Thomas Cech and Sidney Altman also played a role in the discovery winning the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in for their independent discoveries that RNA can act as a catalyst in cell development Nobel Prize for Cech
