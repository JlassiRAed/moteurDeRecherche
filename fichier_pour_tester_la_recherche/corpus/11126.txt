A meristem is a biological tissue tissue in plant s made of cell division dividing cells They are in parts of the plant where growth can take place Plant cells which are Cell differentiation differentiated generally cannot divide or produce cells of a different type Therefore mitosis cell division in the meristem is necessary to get new cells This allows for the growth of tissues and new organs needed by the plant Meristematic cells have the same function for plants as stem cell s have for animal s They are incompletely or not at all differentiated and are capable of continued cell division The cells are small and protoplasm fills the cell completely The vacuole s are extremely small The cytoplasm does not contain plastids Meristematic cells are packed closely together without intercellular cavities The cell wall is a very thin primary cell wall
