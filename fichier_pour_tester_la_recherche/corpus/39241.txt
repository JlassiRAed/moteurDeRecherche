A cantilever bridge is a bridge built using a cantilever A cantilever is only supported on one end For small footbridges the cantilevers may be simple beam beams For large cantilever bridges designed for road or rail traffic the cantilevers are truss es built from structural steel or box girder s built from prestressed concrete The steel truss cantilever bridge was a major engineering breakthrough when it was first used because it can span distances of over They can be more easily built at difficult crossings as they do not need to be supported during the construction
