 Defensins are small cation proteins found in animals and plants They are host defence peptide s They work against bacteria fungus fungi and many viruses Defensins have amino acid s including six to eight conserved cysteine residues Cells of the immune system have these peptides to help kill Phagocyte phagocytosed bacteria Those cells include neutrophil granulocyte s and almost all epithelium epithelial cells Most defensins work by binding to the microbe microbial cell membrane Once there they make tiny holes in the membrane which allow vital ions and nutrients to leak out
