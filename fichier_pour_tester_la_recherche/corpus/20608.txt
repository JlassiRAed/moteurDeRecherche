 Enthalpy is a concept used in science and engineering when heat and Work work need to be calculated When a substance changes at constant pressure enthalpy tells how much heat and work were added to the substance Enthalpy is similar to energy but not the same When a substance grows or shrinks energy is used up or released Enthalpy accounts for this energy Because of this scientists often calculate the change in enthalpy rather than the change in energy The name comes from the Greek word enthalpos meaning to put heat into The idea and the word was made up by the Dutch scientist Heike Kamerlingh Onnes in
