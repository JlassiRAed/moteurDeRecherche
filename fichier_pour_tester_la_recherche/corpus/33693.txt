 Task parallelism threads across different parallel processor nodes It contrasts to data parallelism as another form of parallelism In a Multiprocessing multiprocessor system task parallelism is achieved when each processor executes a different thread on the same or different data The threads may execute the same or different code Different execution threads communicate with one another usually to pass data as they work As a simple example if we are running code on a processor system in order to reduce the runtime of the execution Task parallelism is used by multi user and multitasking operating system s and applications depending on Process Most real programs use a combination of Task parallelism and Data parallelism tech stub
