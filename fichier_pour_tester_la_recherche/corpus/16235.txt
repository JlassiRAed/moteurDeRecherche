A periodic comet is a comet which orbit s around the Sun A short period comet will complete its orbit in less than years A few comets are named after the person who calculated the orbits such as P Encke and P Crommelin It is very difficult to work out the orbit of a long period comet because of the effect of planet s or the release of gas or material from the comet itself Short period comets can be predicted with a lot of accuracy Periodic comets sometimes have the same name for example there are nine Shoemaker Levy comets and twenty four Near Earth Asteroid Tracking NEAT comets The Minor Planet Center a part of the International Astronomical Union gives comets a different number prefix or uses the full title such as P Shoemaker Levy and Shoemaker Levy which are both Comet Shoemaker Levy Sometimes an informal numbering system is used for periodic comets so P is Comet Shoemaker Levy and P is Comet Shoemaker Levy Because non periodic Shoemaker Levy comets are included in the number sequences there appear to be gaps in the numbers for example C B is between Shoemaker Levy and C T is between and C K and C E after Shoemaker Levy In naming a comet the letter before the is Some lists keep the C prefix for comets of with orbits longer than about years until their return is confirmed
