The stack is one of the most important data structure s in computer science To understand how a stack works think of a deck of playing card s that is face down We can only easily wikt access access the card that is on top When we want to look at the top card there are two things we can do we can peek at it but leave it on the stack or we can pop it off When we pop off the top object we are taking it off the stack If we want to add another card to the top of the stack we push A stack is called a last in first out off If the last card we put on our stack of cards was an ace then the first card we pulled from the top is that same ace
