 Crossing over is a basic concept of genetics and cell biology often called recombination It occurs during meiosis Crossing over involves the exchange of chromosome segments between non sister chromatid s during the production of gamete s The effect is to assort the allele s on parental chromosomes so that the gametes carry combinations of gene s different from either parent This has the overall effect of increasing the variety of phenotype s present in a population By suitable means the process can be observed directly in stained cell s and indirectly by the presence or absence of genetic markers on the chromosomes The visible crossovers are called chiasma which is Ancient Greek Greek for a cross F A Janssens was the first to suggest what chiasmata meant The large scale effect of crossing over is to spread variation through a population This is the main consequence of sexual reproduction compared to non sexual modes of reproduction The main advantage to the parents is the greater variety in their offspring This it is thought increases the likelihood that some of the offspring will survive and reproduce This has been the subject of much investigation and discussion
