s Electron s are a well known example that are found in ordinary matter There are six leptons the electron muon and tau particles and their associated neutrinos The different varieties of the elementary particles are commonly called flavors and the neutrino s here are considered to have distinctly different flavor Of the six leptons three have electric charge and three do not The best known charged lepton is the electron The Supersymmetry superparticle of a lepton is called a slepton
