 Seafloor spreading happens at the bottom of an ocean as tectonic plate s move apart The seafloor moves and carries continents with it At ridges in the middle of oceans new oceanic oceanic crust crust is created At the Mid Atlantic Ridge fault s between oceanic plates It forms new crust as the plates move away from each other The new crust then slowly moves away from the ridge Seafloor spreading helps explain continental drift in plate tectonics Earlier theories of continental drift were that continents plow ed through the ocean The modern idea is that the ocean floor itself moves and carries the continent s with it as it expands from a mid ocean ridge Today it is accepted The phenomenon is caused by convection in the weak upper mantle or asthenosphere
