A reaction mechanism is writing step by step how a chemical reaction works Usually only the overall change can be seen in a reaction The things made in between react too quickly to be seen These are called intermediate s and in going from one intermediate to another a transition state is crossed However it is important to understand all the steps that make the total change This is because then one can understand more difficult reactions or try to make a reaction work in a certain way There are many type of reaction mechanisms In organic chemistry the more common ones are nucleophilic substitution elimination reaction elimination and addition reaction addition People sometimes use arrow pushing to draw how electrons move around during a reaction This makes it easy to see which chemical bond bonds are formed and which are broken during the process
