 Dimensions are a concept from mathematics and physics One way to define a dimension is to look at the degree of freedom degrees of freedom a movement has in a specific space There are different concepts where the term dimension is used and there are also different definitons There is no definition that can satisfy all concepts In a vector space a dimension is equal to the cardinality of the minimal Generator generator It is also equal to the cardinality of the maximal set of linear independence linearly independent vector s of that space Normal objects in everyday life are specified by three dimenensions which are usually called length width and depth Mathematicians call this concept Euclidean space Dimensions can be used to measure position too The distance to a position from a start ing place can be measured in the length width and height direction s These distances are a measure of the position Sometimes a fourth space
