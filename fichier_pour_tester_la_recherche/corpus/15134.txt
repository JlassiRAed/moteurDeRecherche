 Kin selection or kin altruism is a form of natural selection Some animal s cooperation cooperate with kinship relative s even if this brings risk to themselves The classic example of this is seen in the family life of mammals or in Colony colonial insect s such as ant s Many mammals and birds raise alarm s to warn others of danger Others cooperate in tasks such as scrub jay s help each other with to build nest s In all these cases where animals cooperate the question is whether there is any biological benefit to themselves It is now clear that there is benefit if the animals are closely related This is because related organisms have a shared genetic inheritance The first to write about the concept were by R A Fisher in The actual term kin selection was probably coined by John Maynard Smith when he wrote These processes I will call kin selection and group selection respectively Kin selection has been discussed by Haldane and by Hamilton By kin selection I mean the evolution of characteristics which favour the survival of close relatives of the affected individual By cooperating relatives influence each other s fitness Under natural selection a gene which improves the fitness of individuals will increase in frequency A gene which lowers the fitness of individuals will become rare However behaviour which enhances the fitness of relatives but lowers that of the actor may nonetheless increase in frequency Relatives do by definition carry many of the same genes This is the fundamental principle behind the theory of kin selection According to the theory the enhanced fitness of relatives may more than compensate for the fitness loss of the helpers This is a special case of a more general model called inclusive fitness
