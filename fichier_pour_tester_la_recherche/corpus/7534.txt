 Radiolaria are amoeba amoeboid protist s which produce mineral skeleton s The skeletons usually of silica have a central capsule This divides the cell into inner and outer portions called endoplasm and ectoplasm Radiolaria are found as zooplankton throughout the ocean and their skeletal remains cover large portions of the ocean floor as radiolarian ooze Radiolaria have existed since the beginning of the Palaeozoic era They take their name from the radial symmetry of most species They are valuable markers or diagnosis diagnostic fossil s because they have a rapid turn over of species This helps to identify strata and to correlate strata at different sites Radiolaria are heterotrophs but also may include protist algae as endosymbiosis endosymbionts
