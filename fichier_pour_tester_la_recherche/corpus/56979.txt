A double bond in chemistry is when two chemical element s are joined together in a chemical bond and share four bonding electron s instead of the usual two The most common double bond is between two carbon atom s and can be found in alkene s There are many types of double bonds such as in a carbonyl group with a carbon atom and an oxygen atom Other common double bonds are found in azo compound s between the two joined atoms When this formula is printed the equals sign is used Double bonds are stronger than covalent bond single bonds and double bonds are also shorter The bond order is two Double bonds are also electron rich which makes them more Reactivity reactive The two pairs of electrons involved in the bond do not behave in exactly the same way One pair of electrons forms a stronger sigma bond sigma sigma bond
