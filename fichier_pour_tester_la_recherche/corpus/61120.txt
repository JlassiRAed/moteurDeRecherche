A debugger is a computer program that is used to test and debug other programs mainly to solve software bug programming bugs Debuggers offer advanced functions such as Running a program step by step Stopping Tracking which means following the values of some variables Some debuggers have the ability to modify the state of the program while it is running rather than watching it only The same feature s which makes a debugger useful for solving software bug s allows it to be used as a software cracking tool to crack copy protection and other software protection features
