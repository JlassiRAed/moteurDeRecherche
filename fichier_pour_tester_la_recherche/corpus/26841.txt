 Terrace farming is a type of farming that consists of different steps or terraces that were developed in various places around the world The Rice Terraces of the Philippine Cordilleras is a World Heritage Site It dates back two thousand years This method of farming uses steps that are built into the side of a mountain or hill On each level various crop s are planted When it rains instead of washing away all of the nutrient s in the soil the nutrients are carried down to the next level Additionally these steps prevent a free flowing avalanche of water that would take plant s with it and destroy all of the crops on the hillside This system also allowed them to build aqueduct s which carried water to each level The idea was also independently developed by the Inca people The Incas built their aqueduct system so well that it is still used today
