The milkweeds Asclepias are a genus of herbaceous perennial plant perennial dicotyledon ous plant s that contains over known species Milkweeds are an important nectar source for bee s and other nectar eaters and a food source for caterpillar s The weeds are eaten by caterpillars of the Monarch These insects are able to feed on the plants despite their chemical defences Milkweed is named after its milky sap which contains alkaloid s latex and several other complex compounds Some species are toxic Pollination in this genus is accomplished in an unusual manner as the pollen is grouped into pollen sacs The feet or mouthparts of flower visiting insects such as bees wasp s and butterflies slip into one of the five slits in each flower formed by adjacent anther s The bases of the pollinia then mechanically attach to the insect pulling a pair of pollen sacs free when the pollinator flies off Pollination is effected by the reverse procedure in which one of the pollinia becomes trapped within the anther slit Milkweeds have three Defence against herbivory defenses to limit damage by caterpillar s and other insects hairs on the leaves toxins and latex fluids Some more recent milkweed species grow faster than older species They have the potential to grow faster than caterpillars can eat them Caterpillars which eat milkweeds and their adult butterflies may be protected by the foul taste of the milkweed chemicals Such butterflies and caterpillars usually show warning colors
