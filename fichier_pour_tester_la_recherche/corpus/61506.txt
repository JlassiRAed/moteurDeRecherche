 Inertia is the resistance of an object to any change in its Motion force For example a rubber ball will not start bouncing around unless someone picks it up and throws it Basically if an object is not moving it will not start moving unless something else acts upon it The same idea can be applied to motion motion an object in motion will stay in motion unless some outside opposing force acts upon it Inertia is also called Sir Isaac Newton s First Law of Motion The First Law of Motion says that 		This basically means Johannes Kepler gave inertia it s name in Epitome Astronomiae Copernicanae   Albert Einstein developed the idea of Special Relativity based on Galileo s statement that it is impossible to tell the difference between a moving object and a stationary one without some outside reference to compare it against
