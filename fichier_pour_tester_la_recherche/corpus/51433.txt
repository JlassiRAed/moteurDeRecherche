 Electrical impedance is the amount of opposition that a circuit presents to Electric current current or voltage change The two main ways to write an impedance are with the resistance R for example with a Magnitude The Impedance and the Electrical resistance resistance are quite similar In the case of resistance a resistor resists any Electric current current going through it The higher the resistance the higher the voltage that is needed to achieve a given current The formula is V R In the case of impedance an inductor resists changes to the current and the capacitor resists changes to the voltage The key difference between resistance and impedance is the word change the rate of change affects the impedance Usually the change is expressed as a frequency the number of times per second the current or voltage change direction The formulas are For the inductor For the capacitor Where Z is the symbol for impedance j is the imaginary number is the constant Pi As indicated by the formulas above the impedance varies depending on the frequency for example at zero Hertz or Direct current DC the impedance of the inductor is zero the same as a short circuit and the impedance of the capacitor is infinite the same as an open circuit Most signals are the sum of many sine waves at various frequencies and each of them experience a different impedance Similarly to the resistance the higher the impedance the higher the voltage that is needed to achieve a given current The formula is V Z At the Matter physical level simplifying many things One important difference between the resistance and the impedance is that a resistor dissipates energy it gets hot but an inductor and a capacitor store the energy and can return that energy to the source when it goes down If the impedance of the source cable and load are not all equal then a fraction of the signal is reflected back to the source wasting power and creating interference The ratio of the en Reflection coefficient reflection can be calculated with is the impedance of the load Any medium that can have a wave has a wave impedance even empty space has an impedance of about en Impedance of free space
