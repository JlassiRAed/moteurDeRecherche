A Wavelet is mathematical function function used to write down a function or signal processing signal in terms of other functions that are simpler to study Many of signal processing tasks can be seen in terms of a wavelet transform Informally speaking the signal can be seen under the lens with a magnification given by the scale of the wavelet In doing so we can only see just the information that is determined by the shape of the used wavelet English term wavelet was introduced in the early s by French physicists Jean Morlet and Alex Grossman They used French word ondelette Afterwards this word was transferred to English by translating onde into wave giving wavelet Wavelet is For practical applications it should satisfy following conditions It must have finite energy It must satisfy admissibility condition Zero mean condition implies from admissibility condition Function is called mother wavelet Its translated normalized versions are defined as following Original mother wavelet has parameters parameter
