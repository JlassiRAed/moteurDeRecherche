In cell biology receptors are special structures that can be found in cell membrane s These are made of protein molecules such as glycoprotein s Receptors bind to specialised molecule s If the receptor has this molecule it is activated but if it does not it is deactivated Depending on its state a change inside the cell happens Cell surface receptors attach to the receptor This triggers changes in the function of the cell The process is called signal transduction The binding starts a chemical change on the inside of the membrane In short receptors work like lock s and key s With the key the lock can be locked or unlocked If it is unlocked the door belonging to it can be opened
