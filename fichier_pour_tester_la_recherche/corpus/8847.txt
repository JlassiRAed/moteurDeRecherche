 Deposition is the Geology geological process where material is added to a landform This happens quite often Some parts of a shore shoreline build up and grow out whereas other parts of the shoreline erosion erode and fall into the sea In deposition wind and water lay down grain s of material that has been Erosion eroded and transported from another place Deposition happens when the forces which transport sediment s are weaker than the forces of particle weight and friction This causes a resistance to movement and the particles drop down Deposition can also refer to the buildup of sediment from organically derived matter or chemical processes
