 Vibration or oscillation means quick moving back and forth waves to the ear and to the brain In structural dynamics and particularly in earthquake engineering vibrations may be unfortunately bad they may cause the structure to failure fail The time it takes a vibrating object to go back and forth completely is the period The number of back and forth movements in one second is its frequency measured in Hertz The farthest possible distance from the equilibrium point is the amplitude
