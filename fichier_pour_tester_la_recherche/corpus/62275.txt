 Southampton Corporation Tramways No or Southampton is an open top tramcar It was built in by Hurst Nelson The tram looks out of proportion as it had to pass through the very low Bathgate Arch in the centre of Southampton A normal sized tram would not have been able to have passed underneath the arch The tramcar operated from until the Southampton system closed in This act began the entire preservation movement of British tramways After it had been purchased the tram travelled the country as there was not yet a museum set up that could store the tram The tram moved to Crich Tramway Village in October and has been there ever since
