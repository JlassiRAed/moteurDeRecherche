The nitrogen cycle is the way that nitrogen in nature is changed into many different forms that are used by living organism s Air is about nitrogen Nitrogen is needed for life It is an important part of proteins DNA and RNA In plants nitrogen is needed for photosynthesis and growth Nitrogen fixation is needed to change the nitrogen in air Some of these bacteria live in the roots of plant s In these roots they make ammonia for the plant and the plant gives them carbohydrates Other plants take nitrogen Chemical compound compounds out of the soil through their roots All nitrogen in animal s comes from eating plants Ammonium in soil is made by nitrogen fixing bacteria and decomposer s bacteria and fungi that break down dead life into its parts This process is called ammonification Ammonium has a positive charge It easily joins to clay and humus in the soil Ammonia and ammonium are poison ous to fish and other animals Sewage and other waste water is regularly measured because of this If ammonia levels are too high nitrification must happen Nitrification is the change of ammonia and ammonium to nitrite by bacteria Because nitrite and nitrate have a negative charge they do not easily join to soil and will wash out of the soil during rain and irrigation High nitrate levels in drinking water is harmful for baby babies and can cause blue baby syndrome High nitrate levels can also cause too much algae growth in lakes and pools This can be harmful to fish and other water animals because the algae uses oxygen that the animals need The use of fertilizer s is controlled more and more because of this Where there is no oxygen some bacteria will make nitrate into nitrogen gas This starts the nitrogen cycle over again This process is called denitrification
