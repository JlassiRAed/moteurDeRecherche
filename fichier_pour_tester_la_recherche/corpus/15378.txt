 Deconstruction is a way of understanding how something was created usually things like art book s poem s and other writing Deconstruction is breaking something down into smaller parts Deconstruction looks at the smaller parts that were used to create an object The smaller parts are usually Idea ideas Sometimes deconstruction looks at how an author can imply things he does not mean It says that because words are not precise we can never know what an author meant Sometimes deconstruction looks at the things the author did not say because he made Assumption assumptions One thing it pays attention to is how opposites work It says that two opposites like good and bad are not really different things Good only makes sense when someone compares it to bad and bad only makes sense when someone compares it to good And so even when someone talks about good they are still talking about bad But this is just one thing it does Because of things like this deconstruction argues that books and poems never just mean what we think they mean at first Other meanings are always there too and the book or poem works because all of those meanings work together The closer we look at the writing the more we find about how it works and how meaning works for all things If we deconstructed everything we might never be able to talk or write at all But that does not mean deconstruction is useless If we deconstruct some things we can learn more about them and about how talking and writing work
