A fault is a fracture or break in the Earth s crust rock move past each other This sometimes makes earthquake s Faulting occurs when shear stress on a rock overcomes the Force forces which hold it together The fracture itself is called a fault plane When it is exposed at the Earth s surface it may form a cliff or steep slope called a fault scarp The angle between the fault plane and an imaginary horizontal plane is called the dip angle of the fault Faults may dip shallowly or steeply Faults are categorized into three types A normal fault is one where the fault dips toward the downthrown block Normal faults occur in rifted terranes such as Mid Ocean Ridge s the Great Rift Valley African Rift and the Basin and Range Province of western North America It is shown on geologic maps as a black line with either a block pattern on the downthrown side or the letters U D showing the upthrown and downthrown sides A reverse fault and thicken the crust They are characteristic of collision origins A transform fault is one where the relative motion is horizontal The fault plane is usually vertical and can be horizontal Famous examples of these include the San Andreas Fault of California the Alpine Fault of New Zealand s south island and the Anatolian Fault in Turkey
