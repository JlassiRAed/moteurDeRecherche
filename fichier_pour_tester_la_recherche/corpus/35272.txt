Throughout the history of the Simple English Wikipedia project there have been a few cases where sysops were desysopped due to incivility or abuse of their powers Other reasons for desysopping included sysops resigning or because of inactivity for a long of time This Wikipedia does not have an arbitration committee so most desysopping is done by consensus of the community
