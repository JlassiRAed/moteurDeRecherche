 Audio crossover is an electric circuit that separates low and high audio frequencies in a signal It is needed because very small loudspeaker s are not able to play higher frequencies purely Audio crossovers are divided to passive or active crossovers Typical components used with passive crossovers are capacitor s inductor s and resistor s If passive crossover uses resistors to adjust loudness those generate heat Instead active devices typically use resistors and capacitors with other audioelectronic components and those typically don t consume so much electric power Also active crossovers are easily built to be adjustable Still that doesn t mean that using passive crossover means low quality
