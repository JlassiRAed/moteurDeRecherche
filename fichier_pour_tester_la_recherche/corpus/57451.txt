 Algebraic geometry is a branch of mathematics studying polynomial equations Modern algebraic geometry is based on more abstract techniques of abstract algebra especially commutative algebra with the language and the problems of geometry The main objects of study in algebraic geometry are algebraic variety algebraic varieties which are geometric manifestations of sets of solutions of systems of polynomial equations Examples of the most studied classes of algebraic varieties are plane algebraic curve s which include line lines circle s parabola s ellipse s hyperbola s cubic curve s like elliptic curve s and quartic curves like lemniscate of Bernoulli lemniscate s and Cassini oval s A point of the plane belongs to an algebraic curve if its coordinates satisfy a given polynomial equation Basic questions involve the study of the points of special interest like the singular point of a curve singular point s the inflection point s and the point at infinity points at infinity More advanced questions involve the topology of the curve and relations between the curves given by different equations Algebraic geometry occupies a central place in modern mathematics The concepts it uses connects it to such diverse fields as complex analysis topology and number theory At the start algebraic geometry was about studying systems of polynomial equations in several variables Algebraic geometry starts at the point where equation solving leaves off In many cases finding the properties all the solutions a given set of equations have is more important than finding a particular solution this leads into some of the deepest areas in all of mathematics both conceptually and in terms of technique this paragraph is misplaced in the lead May be in the history section Descartes s idea of coordinates is central to algebraic geometry because a point of an algebraic variety is a point whose coordinates are a solution of the equations defining the variety However it has undergone a series of remarkable transformations beginning in the early th century Before then the coordinates were assumed to be tuple s of real number s but this changed when first complex number s and then elements of an arbitrary field field became acceptable Homogeneous coordinates of projective geometry offered an extension of the notion of coordinate system in a different direction and enriched the scope of algebraic geometry In the th century algebraic geometry has split into several subareas Much of the development of the main stream of algebraic geometry in the th century occurred within an abstract algebraic framework with increasing emphasis being placed on intrinsic properties of algebraic varieties not dependent on any particular way of embedding the variety in an ambient coordinate space The developments in topology differential geometry differential and complex geometry occurred much in the same way One key achievement of this abstract algebraic geometry is Grothendieck s scheme theory which allows one to use sheaf theory to study algebraic varieties in a way which is very similar to its use in the study of differential manifold differential and complex manifold analytic manifolds This is obtained by extending the notion of point In classical algebraic geometry a point of an affine variety may be identified through Hilbert s Nullstellensatz with a maximal ideal of the coordinate ring while the points of the corresponding affine scheme are all prime ideals of this ring This means that a point of such a scheme may be either a usual point or a subvariety This approach also enables a unification of the language and the tools of classical algebraic geometry mainly concerned with complex points and of algebraic number theory Wiles s proof of Fermat s Last Theorem Wiles s proof of the longstanding conjecture called Fermat s last theorem is an example of the power of this approach
