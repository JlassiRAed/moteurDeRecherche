The English Reformation was part of the Protestant Reformation This led to some Christian churches in Europe breaking away from Roman Catholic Church Rome Each of the countries that went through this process did so in a different way Earlier the Roman Catholic Church had supreme powers Henry VIII broke ties with the church and became head of the English church This was called the Royal Supremacy It was the beginning of the Church of England For years the Church of England was almost exactly the same as the Catholic Church except that it was ruled by the King instead of the Pope This is different from the Reformation on the European continent where the reformers wanted big changes right away There were several causes for the English Reformation One of these was that Henry VIII who was King of England wanted to divorce his wife Catherine of Aragon Another reason was because Henry wanted the Church s wealth and power He thought that this would make him richer and more powerful The Protestant Reformation in Scotland however was based more on the teachings of Martin Luther so it was more like the Reformation in continental Europe
