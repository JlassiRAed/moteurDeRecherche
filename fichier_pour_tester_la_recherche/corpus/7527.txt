 Fermat s Last Theorem is a very famous idea in mathematics It says that If n is a whole number which is higher than then the equation has no Algebraic solution solution s when x y and z are natural number s Pierre de Fermat wrote about it in inside his copy of a book called Arithmetica He said I have a mathematical proof proof of this theorem but there is not enough space in this margin However no correct proof was found for years Mathematicians everywhere think that Fermat in fact did not have a good proof of this theorem
