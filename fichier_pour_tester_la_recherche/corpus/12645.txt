A talent amphora i e a one foot cube The Babylon ians and Sumer ians had a system in which there were shekel s in a mina and minas in a talent which were smaller in magnitude than the mina When used as a measure of money it refers to a talent weight of gold or of silver The gold talent is reported as weighing roughly the same as a person and so perhaps kg would be worth about million Similarly in February the price of silver was about per troy ounce or about cents per gram so a kg silver talent would be worth about Thus when we read that Ptolemy XII Auletes King Auletes of Egypt paid Gaius Julius Caesar the sum of talents of gold to grant him the status of a Friend and Ally of the Roman People This amount would be worth about billion USD today These estimates are only rough values because they are based on modern estimates The value of silver in comparison to gold drastically changed This is because of the output of the Spanish silver mines in the New World In ancient times the same amount of silver was often worth more than gold The estimates do not account for the less technical mining ability of the time nor that there were still native deposits available Later in Roman history during the medieval Byzantine period the emperor Basil II was said to have stockpiled the legendary amount of talents of gold which in modern terms would be worth approximately billion USD At any rate he did save enough money that the Byzantine government was able to remit all taxes paid during the final two years of his reign Another way to calculate the modern equivalent to a talent is from its use in estimating military pay During the Peloponnesian war in Ancient Greece a talent was the amount of silver needed to pay the crew of a trireme for one month Hellenistic mercenaries were commonly paid one drachma for every day of service which was a good salary in the post Alexander the Great Alexander days drachma made a talent The talent as a unit of coinage is mentioned in the New Testament in Jesus parable of the talents One talent was an incredible amount of money
