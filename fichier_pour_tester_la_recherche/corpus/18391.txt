 Astronomical spectroscopy is the science of using spectroscopy to figure out what elements astronomy astronomical bodies such as stars planets and nebula e are made of It can also be used to work out how those objects are moving using doppler shift The study of spectroscopy and spectra is used in astronomy to help scientists study the whole electromagnetic spectrum spectrum of electromagnetic radiation including visible light which radiates from star s and other hot celestial objects Spectroscopy can be used to find properties of distant stars and galaxies It can find out their chemical composition temperature density mass distance luminosity and relative motion using doppler effect measurements
