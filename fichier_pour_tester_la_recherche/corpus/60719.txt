An electron microscope is a scientific instrument which uses a beam of electrons to examine objects on a very fine scale In an optical microscope the wavelength of light limits the maximum magnification that is possible As electrons have a smaller wavelength they can achieve a higher magnification and can see very small objects typically around times smaller than those seen in an optical microscope The outline of objects as revealed by the flow of electrons is changed into a picture using visible light for people to see
