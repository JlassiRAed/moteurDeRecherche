 The Platyzoa are a group of Protostome protostomia proposed by Thomas Cavalier Smith in This is a taxon above the level of phylum and is not part of the usual system of classification Cavalier Smith included here the Platyhelminthes and a new phylum Acanthognatha into which he gathered several previously described phyla of microscopic animals Subsequent studies have supported Platyzoa as a viable clade while differing on the phyla included and on relationships within Platyzoa
