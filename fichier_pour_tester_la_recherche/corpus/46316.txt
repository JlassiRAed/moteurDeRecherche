 Einstein s Cross is an image of a quasar which is light years away The quasar sits directly behind ZW Huchra s lens the lensing galaxy Four images of the same distant quasar appear around this foreground galaxy due to strong gravitational lensing According to its redshift the quasar is about billion light year s from Earth while the lensing galaxy is only million light years away Amateur astronomers are able to see some of the cross using telescopes but it requires extremely dark skies and telescope mirrors with diameters of inches or greater
