 Electronic engineering is a discipline that investigates all kinds of situations related to electricity and magnetism Electronic engineers are concerned with such processes as the transfer of information using radio waves the design of electronic circuits the design of computer systems and the development of control systems such as aircraft auto pilots and other embedded system s The term electronic engineering started to emerge in the late s Before the second world war electronic engineering was commonly known as a radio engineering At that time studying radio engineering at a university was part of a physics degree Later as consumer devices started to be developed the field broadened to include modern TV audio systems Hi Fi and later computers and microprocessors In the mid to late s the term radio engineering gradually gave way to the name electronic engineering which then became a stand alone university degree subject Fundamental studies of the discipline are the sciences of physics and mathematics as these help to get both qualitative and quantitative descriptions of how such systems will work Today most engineering work involves the use of computers and it is commonplace to use computer aided design programs when designing electronics
