In mathematics logic and computer science a formal language is a language that is defined in a precise mathematical way A language is defined using a set called the alphabet alphabet of the language The members of the alphabet are usually called symbols of the language The language is a set of sequence s of symbols of the alphabet The sequences usually have finite length The sequences that are members of the language are called the words of the language or strings A precise definition is that a formal language is a sequence of elements Formal languages have lots of uses A formal language is often thought of as or In the first case the set are then called sentences The mathematical theory that treats formal languages in general is known as formal language theory Although it is common to hear the term formal language meaning natural language that is more stilted disciplined or precise than everyday speech this article refers to the meaning in formal language theory in maths logic or computer science As an example of formal language an alphabet might be A typical language over that alphabet containing that string would be the set of all strings which contain the same number of symbols The empty word is allowed and is often denoted by While the alphabet is a finite set and every string has finite length a language may very well have infinitely many member strings This is because the length of words belonging to it may be unbounded Determining the difficulty of deciding whether a given word belongs to a particular language is problem that Computability theory and Complexity theory deals with
