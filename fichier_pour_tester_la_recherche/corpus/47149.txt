 The following discussion is preserved as an Help Archiving a talk page archive deleted I actually had to think about this one for a bit that is probably why this is being closed a bit late If people disagree feel free to request a review and discuss The event itself is somewhat notable in itself for the news coverage it is also fairly clearly a off event While Wikipedia will contain articles about important news events at times they generally should not that is WP not not the point of the project Looking over the discussion I would point out a couple things Notability is of course important it is really the primary thing to discuss in most RfD s However the fact that it was deleted on another wiki isn t that important other then perhaps a slight mention I have to admit I hate when deleted on en is used as a reason for deletion I ignore it and coming in to say so in bold writing is inappropriate I know that all the articles has been from you While RfD s on other wiki s do not automatically mean it should be deleted or kept on this wiki I will admit to reading them The fact that one of the people who voted keep here voted delete on another wiki was taken into account In the end while those who voted to keep had passionate views I can not justify it given the reasoning of those who voted delete my reading of policy and my own indepth review of the article and story
