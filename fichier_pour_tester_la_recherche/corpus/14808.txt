In real estate a short sale is a way for a homeowner to avoid a foreclosure In both situations the homeowner is at least several months behind on payment s In a foreclosure the bank or Loan lending institution seizes the house and they now own it and have to try to sell it themselves In a short sale the homeowner agrees with the bank to sell it for less than it is Value worth on the market The banks would maybe agree to this because it means the house will get sold saving them the selling responsibility But they are losing money because the house is selling for less than it is worth Sometimes they make the homeowner pay the balance and sometimes they forgive it Short sales are not always a great deal because of the highly Inflation inflated prices of the housing bubble For example if a house that normally costs was suddenly valued at and someone got a loan for that amount they would want to re sell it for or even more to make a profit However values dropped So now they may short sell the house for and lose But to a new buyer that house is probably still not worth So see what the average is for that house over time stub
