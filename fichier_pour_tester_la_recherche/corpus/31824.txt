The popular separation method called Size Exclusion Chromatography first while components that are smaller in size will exit the column last A typical column used in SEC has two substances called phases that interact with the mixture and these substances help force the separation of the mixture The mobile phase is a solvent which helps carry the mixture down the column and the stationary phase which does not move Unlike other chromatography methods the stationary phase used in SEC does not exploit the polarity of each component It is worth noting there is no chemical interaction between the stationary phase and a component So how is it that larger molecules exit the column before smaller molecules The porous material will not allow larger molecules to pass so these molecules go to the next pore and again they cannot pass They eventually get to the bottom of the column and exit the column Remember there is volume inside the column that is not inhabited by the stationary phase which allows for the flow of both the mobile phase and the sample These larger molecules then find themselves at the bottom of the column whereas smaller molecules have a longer path to travel Smaller molecules can pass through a pore and then pass through another one The smaller a molecule is the greater the chance is that it can fit into a pore which means the longer it spends inside the column
