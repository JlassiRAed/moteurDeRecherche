 Over harvesting means taking more from the land than it can replace It includes extreme farming grazing fishing and using fresh water Over harvesting is harmful in the long term Forests or wetland s are hard to replace Damage to nature hurts animal s and humans Most wetlands are damaged by overuse as a source of drinking water and are sometimes drained to make farmland or land for building A thriving and diverse ecosystem is destroyed Over harvesting also applies to animals Population numbers may drop as a result and species may become extinct Overfishing is a typical example Nowadays you can only fish shoot deer or birds at certain times of the year The season when they mate reproduce and lay eggs or have the young protected Areas of especial natural beauty or scientific interest are also protected Taking bird eggs is also now against the law at least in the United Kingdom One thing which acts against conservation is the overpopulation of the world The greatest single reason why the world loses forests is that some people want the land for other purposes A few people gain but everyone shares the cost This is called the tragedy of the commons
