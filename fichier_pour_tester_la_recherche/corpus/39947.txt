 Tentaculata Nuda The phylum Ctenophora the comb jellies is a phylum of marine invertebrates They are part of the plankton and there are also pelagic species The phylum includes the sea gooseberry The phylum was grouped with Cnidaria in the former Coelenterata phylum Ctenophores are the most basal known type of animals Even though they look like jellyfish they are zoologically not related to them They lack the characteristic nematocyst s but have colloblasts sticky cells that snare small victims They have eight rows of cilia which look like the teeth of a comb hence Ctenophore comb bearer Ctenophores have connective tissues and a nervoussystem There are about described species of ctenophora spread throughout the world s oceans from shallow estuarine waters to the deep sea Although there are a few benthic species most are gelatinous zooplankton and form a considerable proportion of the entire planktonic biomass worldwide A few species such as the sea gooseberry native to the North Sea have reached such high populations that they clog fishermen s nets while of other species only a few examples are known The fragile makeup of ctenophores makes research into their way of life extremely difficult For this reason their lifespan is not known but ctenophores begin to reproduce at an early age
