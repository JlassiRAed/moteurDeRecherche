 Chief Joseph was the chief of the Nez Perce Native American s a tribe that lived in what is now the Pacific Northwest of the United States His father was the leader of the Nez Perce before him and his mother was a member of this tribe too When Joseph was young his father always told him not to trust white men he actually had problems with settlers When his father died Joseph became chief of the tribe who resided in plateaus in Northeast Oregon Southeast Washington and Western Idaho The turning point in their relationship to white men was the gold rush in It gave the US Government the opportunity to reduce their reservation to a small area in Idaho Then with the new waves of white men settling in the West the Government wanted to drive Nez Perces away from their territory Chief Joseph was extremely sad this place was the tribe s territory where their ancestors were buried In spite of that he wanted to avoid conflict and remain in peace In he decided to negotiate with the US Government He travelled all the way to Washington D C and spoke to President Ulysses S Grant But he only got mean looks and little attention So a war began in The living conditions of Chief Joseph s tribe were awful they had no food and no blankets Some people were freezing to death But the Nez Perces impressed their enemy thanks to all the battles they won Many men died on both sides That s why Joseph decided to surrender He gave up fighting in He was destroyed by the death of his people and also extremely disappointed he felt betrayed by white people He knew he could not trust them anymore He was tired of being considered a savage He felt it was not fair for people who were born on the same land to be treated differently He delivered a lot of speeches on this subject which are still really good examples of eloquence But he did not feel listened to and when he died in his reservation in the doctor said he died from sadness He was buried in Colville Native American Burial Ground in Washington State
