In computer science a space time or time memory tradeoff is a way of solving a problem or calculation in less time by using more storage space or by solving a problem in very little space by spending a long time Most computers have a large amount of space but not infinite space Also most people are willing to wait a little while for a big calculation but not forever So if your problem is taking a long time but not much memory a space time tradeoff would let you use more memory and solve the problem more quickly Or if it could be solved very quickly but requires more memory than you have you can try to spend more time solving the problem in the limited memory The most common condition is an algorithm using a lookup table This means that the answers for some question for every possible value can be written down One way of solving this problem is to write down the entire lookup table which will let you find answers very quickly but will use a lot of space Another way is to calculate the answers without writing down anything which uses very little space but might take a long time A space time tradeoff can be used with the problem of Data storage device data storage If data is stored uncompressed it takes more space but less time than if the data were stored compressed Larger code size can be used to increase program speed when using loop unwinding This technique makes the Computer program program code longer for each iteration of a loop but saves the computation time needed for jumping back to the beginning of the loop at the end of each iteration In the field of cryptography using space time tradeoff the attacker is decreasing the Exponential function exponential time required for a brute force attack Rainbow table s use partially precomputed values in the hash space of a cryptographic hash function to Cryptanalysis crack password s in minutes instead of weeks Decreasing the size of the rainbow table increases the time required to Iteration iterate over the hash space The meet in the middle attack attack uses a space time tradeoff to find the Key of the normal attack Dynamic programming is another example where the time of solving problems can be decreased by using more memory
