 St George s Chapel is the church at Windsor Castle in England The chapel is governed by the Dean and Canon s of Windsor and is found in the Lower Ward of the castle The status of the Abbey is that of a Royal Peculiar This means it is place of worship that falls directly under the jurisdiction of the British monarch rather than under a bishop The concept dates from Anglo Saxon times when a church could ally itself with the monarch and therefore not be subject to the bishop of the area Technically speaking it is not a cathedral though it has a similar status Many Royal wedding s and other ceremonies with the British Crown have taken place there
