In chemistry a nitride is a compound of nitrogen with a less electronegativity electronegative element attached together in a specific way Nitrides are a large class of compounds with a wide range of properties and applications Most of the names for nitrides follow a simple pattern the name of the element attached to the nitrogen then nitride So GaN would be gallium nitride There are some exceptions however for the compounds that has had a usual name before For example NH is not called hydrogen nitride even if it is the most simple of this class of molecules but it is still commonly called ammonia
