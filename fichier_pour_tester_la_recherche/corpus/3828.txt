The simplified molecular input line entry specification or SMILES is a line notation for the chemistry chemical structure of molecule s It uses a short series ASCII characters to represent structures Most molecule editor computer programs can draw a two dimensional diagram or a dimension three dimensional model of a molecule based on its SMILES code Arthur Weininger and David Weininger wrote the original SMILES specification in the late s It has since been modified and extended by others including by Daylight Chemical Information Systems Inc In the Blue Obelisk open source chemistry community developed an open standard called OpenSMILES In July the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry IUPAC introduced the International Chemical Identifier InChI as a standard line notation for representing chemical structures People think that it is easier for humans to understand SMILES than InChI Some chemists argue that SMILES is better than InChI because many different software programs support it SMILES also has theory theoretical backing
