A siltstone is a mudrock For a rock to be a siltstone it must be over fifty percent silt sized material Silt is any particle smaller than sand Silt is the product of physical weathering such as freezing and thawing Physical weathering does not involve any chemical changes in the rock just its physical breaking apart One of the highest proportions of silt found on Earth is in the Himalayas which get rainfall of up to five to ten meters a year Quartz and feldspar are the biggest contributors to silt Silt tends to be non cohesive non plastic but can liquefy easily There is a simple field test to judge whether a rock is a siltstone or not and that is to put the rock to one s teeth If the rock feels gritty against one s teeth than it is a siltstone
