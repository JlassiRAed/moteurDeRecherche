 Tetrapodomorpha is a clade of vertebrate s It is a subclass of the Sarcopterygii consisting of tetrapod s and their closest relatives Advanced transitional fossil s between fish and the early labyrinthodont s like Tiktaalik are wikt informal informally called fishapod s by their discoverers They are half fish half tetrapod s in appearance and limb morphology Tetrapodomorpha contains the stem group tetrapoda extinct fossil relatives of the crown group This is a paraphyletic unit covering the fish to tetrapod transition Tetrapodomorpha contains several groups of related lobe finned fish es collectively known as the osteolepiform s the crown group tetrapods the last common ancestor of living tetrapods and all of its descendant s Among the characters defining tetrapodomorphs are modifications to the fins notably a humerus with convex head articulating with the glenoid fossa Tetrapodomorph fossils are known from the early Devonian onwards and include Eusthenopteron Osteolepis Panderichthys Tiktaalik Ventastega and Kenichthys The fossils of the early Mississippian Pederpes and Whatcheeria are regarded as early tetrapod s whose relationships are not yet clear
