 Automata theory is a branch of Theoretical computer science Automata theory is concerned with the study of abstract machine s called automaton automata and with the problems that can be solved using such machines An automaton is characterized by a number of states it can be in a number of transitions between those states and an alphabet of symbols it accepts One state is special it is the state the automaton is in at the start There are a number of states that are called final states or exit states if at the end of the input the automaton is in one of those states it is said to accept the word just processed otherwise it is said to reject it Example problems of automata theory include The question to know whether a given automaton is the smallest possible that accepts a given number of words There are algorithm s that permit to reduce the number of states by combining different states that are equivalent
