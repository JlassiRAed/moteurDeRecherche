The noble gases are a group of elements that are all gas es These elements are all in group of the periodic table All of them are monoatomic meaning each molecule is a single atom They almost never react with other chemical element elements This is because they have a full electrons outer electron shell There are six noble gases All of these gases are found in air They make up around of the atmosphere Noble gas compound s can be formed from noble gases When the noble gases are used in cold cathode tubes to produce light each of them has a different colour Since Radon is radioactive it is usually not used for lighting Here are pictures of what the others look like Image HeTube jpg HeliumImage NeTube jpg NeonImage ArTube jpg ArgonImage KrTube jpg KryptonImage XeTube jpg Xenon Ununoctium This means its use is probably limited Noble gases were discovered by John Strutt Lord Rayleigh and Sir William Ramsay Rayleigh won the Nobel Prize in Physics in for his work on noble gas
