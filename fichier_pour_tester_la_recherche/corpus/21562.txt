The Hubble Deep Field sometimes called the HDF is an image of a small part of the night sky in the constellation Ursa Major Ursa Major that was taken by the Hubble Space Telescope in It is important because it shows some of the farthest away galaxies ever seen over in total The area of the sky the HDF was taken in makes up less than th the width of a full Moon yet it contains over galaxies Because of the time it takes for light from these galaxies to reach Earth some in the picture look exactly as they did over billion years ago Because of this it allows scientists to look at what the Universe was like at that time and how it changed to become what it is now Add to this the cosmological principle which suggests that on large scales the Universe is roughly the same no matter what direction you look and the HDF becomes a very important tool for astronomer s studying how the Universe has changed For these reasons the HDF is sometimes called the most important image ever taken
