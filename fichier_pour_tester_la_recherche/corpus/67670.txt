In computing optimization is the process of modifying a system to make some features of it work more Algorithmic efficiency efficiently or use fewer resource s For instance a computer program may be optimized so that it runs faster or to run with less Computer memory memory requirements or other resources or to consume less energy This is a branch of software engineering The optimization can have sense at different levels from the lowest up to the highest levels of making of implementation use or design of algorithms The optimization is generally recommended to leave until the end of the process of development since the premature optimization can introduce new errors The optimized system may be a single computer program a collection of computer s or even an entire network such as the Internet
