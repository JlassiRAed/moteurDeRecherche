A fuel cell converts the Chemical element element hydrogen into electricity by mixing it with oxygen which then creates water It is like a battery that is constantly fed with fuel It is an important part of the hydrogen economy Note that unlike oil hydrogen is not found in nature and is not an energy source but an energy carrier It has to be produced first and if this is done by burning fossil fuels it does not help against climate change But the hydrogen fuel cell will help against climate change in future because scientists are trying to find new ways to make hydrogen without using fossil fuels
