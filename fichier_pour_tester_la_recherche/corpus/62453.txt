 Bamberga is the th biggest asteroid in the Asteroid belt Main asteroid belt It was found by Johann Palisa on February in Vienna making it one of the last big asteroids found Apart from the near earth asteroid Eros Eros it was the last asteroid which is ever easily visible with binoculars to be found Although its very high orbital eccentricity means its opposition magnitude varies a lot at a rare opposition near perihelion Bamberga can reach a apparent magnitude magnitude of which is as bright as Saturn Titan Such near perihelion oppositions happen on a regular cycle every twenty two years with the last happening in and the next in Its brightness at these rare near perihelion oppositions makes Bamberga the brightest C type asteroid about one magnitude brighter than Hygiea s maximum brightness of around At such an opposition Bamberga can in fact be closer to Earth than any main belt asteroid with magnitude above getting as close as astronomical unit AU For comparison Iris never comes closer than AU and Vesta never closer than AU when it becomes visible to the naked eye in a air pollution pollution free sky Overall Bamberga is the tenth brightest main belt asteroid after in order Vesta Vesta Pallas Pallas Ceres Ceres Iris Iris Hebe Hebe Juno Juno Melpomene Melpomene Eunomia Eunomia and Flora Flora Its high eccentricity though means that at most oppositions other asteroids reach higher magnitudes It has an unusually long rotation period among the big asteroids Its spectral class is between the C type asteroid C type and P type asteroid s An occultation of Bamberga was seen on December and gave a diameter of about km in agreement with IRAS results
