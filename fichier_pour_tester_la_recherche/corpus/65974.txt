 Behaviourism is an approach to study behaviour based only what can be directly seen Behaviorists focus on relationships between stimulus stimuli and wikt response responses Unseen qualities such as states of mind By definition all behaviour can be observed Behaviorism also relied on another idea that all human behaviour was learned Behaviorists believed that behavior could be explained by classical or operant conditioning This is learning as a result of influences from past experiences However behaviourists denied the importance of inherited behaviours instinct instincts that something can come from a person s genes This was the idea of the blank slate that babies are born with a clean empty mind Humans when born are thought not have mental experience or knowledge and that everything is learned after they grow The blank slate premise is opposed by modern evolutionary psychology Major contributors scientists to the field of behaviorism include C Lloyd Morgan Ivan Pavlov Edward Thorndike John B Watson and B F Skinner Pavlov researched classical conditioning through the use of dogs and their natural ability to saliva salivate produce water in their mouths Thorndike and Watson rejected introspection introspective methods looking at one s own conscious thoughts and feelings They wanted to restrict psychology to experiment experimental methods Skinner s research leant mainly on behaviour shaping using positive reinforcement Today ideas from behaviourism are used in cognitive behavioral therapy Cognitive behavioral therapy can help people deal with anxiety anxieties and phobia s as well as with certain forms of addiction As a scientific theory behaviourism has largely been replaced by cognitive psychology
