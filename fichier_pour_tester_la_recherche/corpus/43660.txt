In geometry a tangent is a straight line that touches a curve at one Point For this reason a tangent line is a good approximation of the curve near that point The curve and the tangent line are almost exactly the same near the intersection point A line straight line which touches a circle at a single point is Perpendicularity perpendicular to the circle s radius and is considered tangent to the circle
