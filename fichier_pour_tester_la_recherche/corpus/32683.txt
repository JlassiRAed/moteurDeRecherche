A rectifier is a device that can convert Alternating current This is a process called rectification Rectifiers are made of metals like copper iron and silver They can amplify things such as sound in a stereo cite web url Half wave rectifiers only have one side of a waveform while the full wave rectifiers use both sides of a waveform The left hand side of the full wave rectifier circuit consists of four diodes a diode bridge Half wave current is a current that can only flow in alternate current a full wave current can flow both alternating current and direct current Diode bridge is electrical circuit that consists of four diode s It acts as a full wave rectifier to convert alternating current to direct current
