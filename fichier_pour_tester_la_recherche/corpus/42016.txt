 Composite particles are subatomic particle s that are made of more than one quark Simple particle s like proton s are actually composites of multiple quarks Protons are known as baryon s which means that they are made of exactly three quarks Baryons are in a family called Hadron s which simply means that they are made of quarks The only other subcategory of Hadrons is Meson s which are made of one quark and one Antiparticle antiquark Since they are made of quark s composite particles are not so much hard balls but rather like clouds that contain these quarks Depending on the Kinetic energy energy contained by the quarks the quarks of a proton vibrate and this gives a proton a size larger than the actual size of the three quarks combined en List of particles Composite particles
