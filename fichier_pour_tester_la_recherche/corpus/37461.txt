A vaccination is a treatment which makes the body stronger against a particular infection The body fights infections using the immune system which is made up of millions upon millions of cells including T cells and B cells An important feature of the immune system is that it is much stronger when fighting a disease which it has already fought against before Vaccination involves showing the immune system something which looks very similar to a particular virus or bacteria which helps the immune system be stronger when it is fighting against the real infection
