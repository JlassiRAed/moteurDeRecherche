 Sociocultural theory was created by Lev Vygotsky as a response to Behaviorism The main idea of the theory is that the ways people interact with others and the culture they live in shape their mental abilities Vygotsky believed that parents relatives peers and society all have an important role in forming higher levels of functioning Sociocultural theory as stated by Cole John Steiner Scribner and Souberman is the belief that every function in the child s cultural development appears twice first on the social level and later on the individual level This means that the skills children learn first are related to interactions with others and they then take that information and use it within themselves
