In electronics a voltage divider is an electrical circuit which creates an output voltage which is proportional to an input voltage Voltage dividers are also known as resistor divider and potential divider It can be made of two resistor s or it can be one potentiometer The output voltage is depends on component values or on the setting of the potentiometer When an electrical load gets power from the divider s center point the voltage may change category Electronic circuits
