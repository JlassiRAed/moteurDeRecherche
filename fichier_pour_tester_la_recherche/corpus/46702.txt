A restriction enzyme is an enzyme that cuts DNA at particular places It works at or near specific recognition nucleotide sequences known as restriction sites To cut DNA all restriction enzymes make two incisions once through each strand of the DNA double helix These enzymes are found in bacteria and archaea and defend them against invading virus es which are bacteriophage s Inside a prokaryote the restriction enzymes selectively cut up foreign DNA in a process called restriction The host DNA is protected by another enzyme which protects the host DNA and blocks cleavage Together these two processes are the restriction modification system Over restriction enzymes have been studied in detail and more than of these are available commercially
