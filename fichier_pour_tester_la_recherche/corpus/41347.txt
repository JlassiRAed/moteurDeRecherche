 A castle is a Fortification fortified wikt structure structure made in Europe and the Middle East during the Middle Ages People argue about what the word castle means However it usually means a private structure of a lord or nobility noble This is different from a Fortification fortress which is not a home and from a fortified town which was a public defence For about years that castles were built they had many different shapes and different details Castles began in Europe in the th and th centuries They controlled the places surrounding them and could both help in attacking and defending Weapons could be fired from castles or people could be protected from enemies in castles However castles were also a symbol of Influence power They could be used to control the people and roads around it Many castles were built with earth and wood at first often using manual labour and then had their wikt defence defences replaced by stone instead Early castles often used nature for protection and did not have towers By the late th and early th centuries though castles became longer and more complex Europe began using gunpowder in the th century It did not stop castle building at first But by the th century shots became powerful enough to break through stone walls Castles were still built but new ways to protect castles from cannon s and gun s made them uncomfortable places to live in Because of this people stopped building true castles Instead country houses or military forts were built From the th century people began building castles again from new interest in Gothic architecture but they were not used for fighting
