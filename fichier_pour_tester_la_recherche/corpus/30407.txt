In Computer science client server is a computer architecture software architecture model consisting of two parts client systems and server process are running on the same computer this is called a single seat setup Another type of related software architecture is known as peer to peer because each host or Process and because each has equivalent responsibilities and status Peer to peer architectures are often abbreviation abbreviated using the acronym PP The client server relationship describes the relation between the client and how it makes a service request to the server and how the server can accept these requests process them and return the requested information to the client The interaction between client and server is often described using sequence diagram s Sequence diagrams are standardized in the Unified Modeling Language Both client server and PP architectures are in wide usage today The basic type of client server software architecture employs only two types of hosts client s and server s This type of architecture is sometimes referred to as two tier The two tier architecture means that the client acts as one tier and server Process process acts as the other tier The client server software architecture has become one of the basic models of network computing Many types of applications have been written using the client server model Standard networked functions such as E mail exchange World Wide Web web access and database access are based on the client server model For example a web browser is a client program at the user computer that may access information at any web server in the world
