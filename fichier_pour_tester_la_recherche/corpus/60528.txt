This is my first article for Wikipedia Simple News Simple News and I thought I would make a little column with no real focus just exploring anything that comes to mind and of course my obligatory b Wikibooks plug I m not generally a writer so please bear with me This issue I will be covering some simple Wikimarkup shorthand that people may find useful along with some rudimentary javascript you can use to customise your viewing experience although this is very basic and there are probably better ways of doing things
