The stratosphere is one of the layers of the atmosphere of the planet Earth It extends from about km above the poles to about km In the stratosphere the temperature rises with increasing height This makes the stratosphere very stable This temperature gradient is caused by the ozone layer which absorbs some Ultraviolet UV radiation from sunlight The absorbed radiation is converted to heat This differs from the lower layer the troposphere where temperature declines with higher altitude
