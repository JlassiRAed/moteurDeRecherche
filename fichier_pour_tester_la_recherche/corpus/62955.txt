 Weasel words are small words added to the start of a statement like some argue that or critics say etc The bad thing about weasel worded statements is that their implication is misleading or too vague to substantiate Even if an author intended to buttress an argument with an estimate of support weasel words dilute meaning or make sentences open to multiple interpretations Weasel words help to obscure the meaning of biased expressions and are therefore dishonest For example an editor might preface the statement Montreal is the best city in the world with a disclaimer some people say that Montreal is the best city in the world This is true some people do say that Montreal is the best city in the world The problem is that the reverse is true as well Another problem is that weasel words can imply that a statement is more controversial than it is For example saying some people claim that Queen question about the statement s truth If a statement is true without weasel words remove them If they are needed for the statement to be true consider removing the statement If there is a genuine opinion make the preface more specific Who are these people When where and why did they say that What kind of bias might they have How many is some If you consider the different answers these questions might have you can see how meaningless the some people say qualification is To assist users in deciding how to attribute ideas more precisely the Wikipedia Wikipedia Verifiability verifiability policy provides specific criteria for the support a statement must have for it to remain in an article unchallenged This is one of Wikipedia s core content policies determining the type and quality of material that is acceptable in articles and it is this policy that weasel words undermine
