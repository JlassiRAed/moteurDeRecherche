The Kepler conjecture is a mathematics mathematical conjecture about Sphere packing in three dimensional eucliean geometry Euclidean space It is named after Johannes Kepler who first had this idea Kepler supposed that the ways to pack sphere s of equal size that result in the packing with the highest density are Cubic crystal system face centered cubic or Hexagonal crystal system hexagonal packings These packings have a density of slightly over percent this means that they fill about percent of space available
