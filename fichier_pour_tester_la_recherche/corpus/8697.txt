A molecule is the smallest amount of a chemical substance that can exist If a molecule were split into smaller pieces it would be a different substance Molecules are made up of atom s that are stuck together in a particular shape or form Not all combinations of atoms are usually possible atoms like certain shapes but not others Also they like certain arrangements of atoms For example oxygen atoms always have two bonds with other atoms carbon atoms always have four bonds with other atoms and nitrogen atoms always have three bonds with other atoms In gas es like air the molecules are just flying around In liquid s like water the molecules are stuck together but they can still move In solid s like sugar the molecules can only vibrate There is also another state of matter known as plasma where the molecules fly around crazier and faster than those in a gas With a molecular formula you can write down the numbers of all atoms in a molecule For example the molecular formula of glucose is C That means that one molecule of glucose is made up of six carbon atoms twelve hydrogen atoms and six oxygen atoms
