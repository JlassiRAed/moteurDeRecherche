The Euler characteristic of a shape is a number that describes a topological space so that anything in the space will have the same number It is calculated by taking the number of Point points in the shape the number of line s in the shape and the number of wikt face faces of the shape Then you find the Euler characteristic with this formula V is the point count E the line count and F the amount of faces For most common shapes the Euler Characteristic is math stub
