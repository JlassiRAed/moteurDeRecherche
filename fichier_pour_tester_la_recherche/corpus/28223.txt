A major histocompatibility complex or MHC is a molecule on the outside of immune cell s such as white blood cells It is code d for by a large Gene duplication gene family in all vertebrate s The function of is MHC molecules to sense foreign antigen s and hence the presence of foreign proteins They bind peptide fragments from pathogen s onto their cell membrane cell surface Once there the fragments are recognised by T cell s Adaptive immunity depends on this reaction
