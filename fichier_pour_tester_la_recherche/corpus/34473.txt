Parasuchia Phytosaurs are an extinct group of large semi aquatic Upper Triassic archosaur s Phytosaurs were long snouted and heavily armour ed bearing a remarkable resemblance to modern crocodile s in size appearance and lifestyle This is an example of Convergent evolution convergence or parallel evolution The name phytosaur means plant reptile the first fossils of phytosaurs were mistakenly thought to belong to plant eaters The sharp teeth in phytosaur jaws clearly show they were predators Although phytosaurs were not true crocodilians themselves they were more closely related to the crocodilians than to other modern reptiles Crocodiles did not become phytosaur like until the Lower Jurassic Consensus generally places phytosaurs as basal crurotarsans possibly the basal most group Brusatte Stephen L et al The higher level phylogeny of Archosauria Journal of Systematic Palaeontology Phytosaurs had a nearly global distribution Fossils have been recovered from Europe North America India Morocco Thailand Brazil and Madagascar
