 Kilik Pass from the north This was the shortest and quickest way into northern Kashmir from the Tarim Basin and one that was usually open all year but was extremely dangerous and only suited for travellers on foot From Tashkurgan one travelled just over km south to the junction of the Minteke River Heading some km west up this valley one reached the Mintaka Pass which both led into upper Hunza from where one could travel over the infamous rafiqs or hanging passages to Gilgit and on either to Kashmir or to the Gandharan plains Laden animals could be taken over the Mintaka and Kilik passes into upper Hunza or west to Chitral which provided relatively easy access to either Jalalabad or Peshawar via Swat The Mintaka Pass was the main one used in ancient times until the fairly recent advance of glacier ice After the glaciation of the Mintaka Pass the Kilik Pass was favoured by caravans coming from China and Afghanistan as it is wider free of glaciers and provided enough pasture for caravan animals The new Karakoram Highway heads farther south and then west over the Khunjerab Pass
