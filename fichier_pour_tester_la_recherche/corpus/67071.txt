 Evaporation is when a liquid becomes a gas without forming bubble s inside the liquid volume If bubbles are formed we are talking instead about boiling For example water left in a bowl will slowly disappear The water evaporates into water vapor the gas phase of water The water vapor mixes with the air The reverse of evaporation is condensation When the molecules in a liquid are heated they move faster This makes them full of energy and so the particles collide with each other and eventually they become so far apart that they become a gas
