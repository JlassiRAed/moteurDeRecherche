A particle detector also known as a radiation detector is a device used to high energy Elementary particle particle s These particles can be made by nuclear decay cosmic radiation or reactions in a particle accelerator Particle detectors are used in particle physics nuclear physics and nuclear engineering Modern detectors are also used as calorimeters to measure the energy of radiation They can measure other things such as the momentum Spin Spin in Quantum Theory spin or Electric charge charge of the particles
