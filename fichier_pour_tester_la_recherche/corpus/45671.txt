 Environmental chemistry is the science scientific study of the chemical and biochemical phenomena that wikt occur occur in natural places Environmental chemistry can be defined as the study of the sources reactions transport effects and fates of chemical species in the Earth s atmosphere air soil and water body water environments and the effect of human activity on these Environmental chemistry is an Interdisciplinarity interdisciplinary science that includes Atmospheric chemistry atmospheric Aquatic chemistry aquatic and soil chemistry as well as uses analytical chemistry It is related to Environmental science environmental and other areas of science It is different from green chemistry which tries to reduce potential pollution at its source Environmental chemistry starts by understanding how the uncontaminated environment works It identifies the chemicals that are present naturally It studies the concentration and effects of those chemicals Then it accurately study the effects humans have on the Natural environment environment through the release of chemicals Environmental chemist s draw on a range of concepts from chemistry and various environmental sciences to assist in their study of what is happening to a chemical in the Ecosystem environment Important general concepts from chemistry include understanding chemical reaction s and Chemical equation equations solution s Units of measurement units Sampling sampling and Analytical chemistry analytical techniques Chemists study compounds with biological activity such as pheromone s
