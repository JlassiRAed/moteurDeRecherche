The idea that all life evolved was hotly debated even before Charles Darwin published On the Origin of Species Even today some people still talk about the concept of evolution and what it means to them to their philosophy and their religion Sometimes these people also talk about the social implications of evolution This debate is mostly about the meaning of evolution to human life or about human nature not about how evolution works
