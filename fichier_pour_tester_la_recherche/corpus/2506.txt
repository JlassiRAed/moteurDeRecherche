One of the things that most Wikipedians aim for is to achieve at least one Good Article and or at least one Very Good Article We have a very good process here at the Simple English Wikipedia but its main fallback is that there are not enough active users nominating and voting for the articles In the closing days of both of our processes were several weeks out of date due to no interest User Eptalon Eptalon did a very good job of trying to revive the process and it is now running fairly smoothly However many of the candidates are still being declined due to a lack of votes Good Articles need to have votes There are also percentage requirements The majority of the GA and VGA candidates currently at voting do not meet these criteria and are due to close on the th January Many are up to their respective standards but do not have enough votes to allow them to gain the titles that are rightly theirs Another issue is articles that are being turned away because they are being nominated but no one is acting on the comments raised in the nomination The pays for all the hard work that you would have put in Finally we need more people to actually nominate articles that are eligible We are going to run out of VGA candidates in a couple of weeks and GA candidates soon after So how can you help Well head over to WP PVGA proposed Very Good Articles or WP PGA proposed Good Articles and give your thoughts or go write some articles and nominate them As I have said it is a very time consuming but rewarding process I ve added my GA nomination have you January UTC
