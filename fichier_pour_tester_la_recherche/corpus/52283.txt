In physics power It may take a certain amount of work to make a change in the world such as lifting a heavy weight to a higher level It makes no difference if the weight is lifted slowly or quickly The same amount of work will have been performed The difference between a slow lift and a quick lift is that a quick lift requires more power This means the work can be done in a shorter time if there is more power available As a rate of change of work done or the energy of a subsystem power is where P is power W is Work work and t is time Power is also equal to force times velocity
