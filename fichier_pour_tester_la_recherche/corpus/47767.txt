 Drosophila pseudoobscura is a species of Drosophila fruit fly used extensively in lab studies of the genetics of natural populations It was first used by Theodosius Dobzhansky and his colleagues They collected samples from populations in western North America and Mexico and grew them in population cages in the laboratory They were interested in natural selection genetic drift and other aspects of population genetics In Diane Dodd gave laboratory populations of D pseudoobscura two different food types starch and maltose They rapidly evolved into two distinct groups after only eight generations with the different foods As the two groups both showed a strong preference for mating with their own type this was claimed as an example of speciation by reproductive isolation In D pseudoobscura was the second Drosophila species to have its genome sequenced after Drosophila melanogaster
