 Sealand is a self claimed country in the North Sea but it is not an island A structure called Roughs Tower was built in the sea by the British Royal Navy and later became Sealand It is very small There is only room for people on it Even though a man named Michael Bates says Sealand is a country not all countries agree with him Once some people from The Netherlands went to Sealand to take it over Michael Bates did not want this to happen so he used helicopter s and fought them to get it back He won and put some of those people in jail until he was pressured to let them go by other countries If a boat goes too near Sealand people from Sealand might fire guns at the boat Even though Michael Bates says he is the prince of Sealand it is very small so he usually is not there Other people stay there to take care of Sealand Sealand has its own stamps national anthem money flag and more things just like a real country Bates reasons why Sealand should be a real country are these Sealand is out in the ocean and when Sealand was created no country owned the ocean Also people asked Michael Bates to let his prisoners from The Netherlands go Bates said that if they thought Sealand was not a country they would not ask him to do that
