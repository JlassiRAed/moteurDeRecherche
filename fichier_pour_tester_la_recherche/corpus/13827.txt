The term red beds usually refers to stratum strata of red dish colored sedimentary rock s such as sandstone siltstone or shale that were deposited in hot climates under oxidation oxidizing conditions They are usually formed in terrestrial situations on land and in river s and lake s The red color comes from iron oxide in their mineral structure Although they have been deposited throughout the Phanerozoic they are most commonly associated with rocks deposited during the Devonian Permian and Triassic periods The Old Red Sandstone is one of the most famous rock formation s Red beds have economic significance since many of them contain reservoirs of petroleum and natural gas Secondary red beds are linked to the uplift erosion and surface weathering of previously deposited sediments and require conditions similar to primary red beds for their formation
