Every wiki page has an associated talk page which can be used for discussion and communicating with other users Talk pages can be accessed by clicking the Discussion tab at the top of the page Simply edit the page as normal to add your comment A talk page is actually very similar to any other wiki page but it is in the talk namespace to keep it separate from the articles in the main namespace As with any wiki page you can change it link to it and see the history of the page
