 Creationism is the idea that life on earth was created by God This idea comes from a literal reading of scripture very often the Bible Today almost all scientists believe evolution is a good explanation These scientists say that the scientific method does not allow certain explanations mostly those that include supernatural elements For this reason a movement called Neo creationism wants to re state the ideas behind creationism and restart the discussion over the Creation myth origins of life The followers want to do this in such a way that religious terms are not used and that there are no references to scripture This should make it easier to talk to other groups such as the scientific community or the general public
