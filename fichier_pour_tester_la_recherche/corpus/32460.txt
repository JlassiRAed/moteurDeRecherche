 It is a multiple system of at least three stars The strange shapes taken by the clouds are a result of the vast radiation emitted by these huge hot stars This image combines image data with three different filter s in visible light from the metre Denmark Danish telescope at the ESO La Silla Observatory in Chile A star is a giant ball of very hot gas That gas is called plasma plasma Stars are held together by gravity They give out heat and light because they are so hot Special reactions happen in a star Those reactions are called nuclear fusion Nuclear fusion makes light and heat and makes bigger and bigger chemical element s Stars have a lot of hydrogen Nuclear fusion changes hydrogen into helium When a star gets old it starts to change the helium into other bigger chemical elements like carbon and oxygen Fusion makes a lot of energy The energy makes the star very hot The energy produced by stars moves away from them The energy leaves as light which we call electromagnetic radiation
