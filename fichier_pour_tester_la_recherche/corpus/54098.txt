 Ancient Australia covers the time from when the first humans came to Australia to the arrival of the First Fleet in Aboriginal artefacts on Rottnest Island have been dated from to more than years ago However more recent evidence suggests human occupation by or even before years ago During the Pleistocene period sea levels were much lower than they are today This would have made Human migration migration from Asia to Australia much easier than it is now The land bridge between Australia and New Guinea was blocked by rising sea levels about years ago It is not known what the first Australians looked like The first Australians had dark skin and black hair Most of them were hunter gatherer s hunting animals and collecting plants to eat They were nomadic people moving from place to place in search of seasonal foods They developed into different ethnic group s and each group had its own language and traditions In it is estimated that there were about separate language groups in Australia Each of these language groups was made up of many smaller groupings These smaller groups often combined for ceremonial and trade activities Because they were all different it is difficult to make general claims about Aboriginal traditions and beliefs
