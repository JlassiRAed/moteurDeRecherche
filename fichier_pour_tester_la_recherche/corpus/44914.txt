An object in grammar is the target of an action and occurs in any sentence with a transitivity transitive verb It is an element in the clause which follows the verb as in The cat sat on the mat She hit him These are direct objects The following are indirect objects The dog brought Jane his lead I sent my son a letter The structure of these sentences is subject V verb and O object The first object is an indirect object the second is a direct object Notice that in the last example you sent a letter not your son The sentence makes perfect sense without the indirect object An equivalent sentence to the last example is I sent a letter to my son Here some grammarians also see son as the indirect object The Oxford companion to the English language Oxford University Press
