In chemistry chemical synthesis means using chemical reaction s to get a product and established to work in multiple laboratories Chemists start to design a chemical synthesis by selecting chemical compound compounds to combine These starting compounds are known as reagent s or reactant s Chemists use List of reactions various reaction types to these to synthesize the product or an intermediate product This requires mixing the compounds in a reaction vessel work up procedure before the final product is isolated The amount of product in a chemical synthesis is the Yield chemical yield s are expressed as a weight in gram s or as a percentage of the total theoretical quantity of product that could be produced A side reaction is an unwanted chemical reaction taking place that reduces the yield of the wanted product The chemist Adolph Wilhelm Hermann Kolbe was the first to use the word synthesis in its present day meaning
