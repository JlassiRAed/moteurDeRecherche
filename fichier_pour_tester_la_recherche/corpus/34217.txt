An axiom is a concept in logic It is a statement which is accepted without question and which has no proof The axiom is be used as the premise or starting point for further reasoning or arguments This means it cannot be proved within the discussion of a problem So inside some discussion it is thought to be true There are many reasons why it has no proof For example The statement might be obvious This means most people think it is clearly true An example of an obvious axiom is the principle of contradiction It says that a statement and its opposite cannot both be true at the same time and place The statement is based on physical law s and can easily be observed An example is Newton s laws of motion They are easily observed in the physical world The statement is a proposition Here an axiom is any mathematical statement that serves as a starting point from which other statements are logically derived This means we care more about what happens if the axiom is true Whether the proposition is empiricism empirically true is not the business of logic This is a more modern definition of an axiom Logic can be used to find theorem s from the axioms Then those theorems can be used to make more theorems This is often how math works Axioms are important because logical arguments start with them
