An ion thruster is a kind of spacecraft engine It works by using static electricity or magnetism to push ions out the back of the spacecraft It takes a very long time to speed up but its fuel lasts much longer than a rocket engine It has to be carried into outer space by a regular rocket because the ions don t push hard enough for it to escape the Earth s gravity but after it gets to outer space it can travel a very long way An ion thruster needs electricity to run so the spacecraft has to also carry solar panels or a nuclear reactor The NASA space probe called Dawn Ceres
