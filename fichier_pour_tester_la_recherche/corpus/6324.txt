The Tyndall effect is when light is scattered by particles of matter in its path It makes a beam of light visible by lighting the particles Under the Tyndall effect the longer wavelength light is more transmitted while the shorter wavelength light is more reflected by wikt scatter scattering In effect blue light is scattered much more strongly than red light The blue of a clear sky and the blue of blue eyes is caused by the Tyndall effect not by a pigment
