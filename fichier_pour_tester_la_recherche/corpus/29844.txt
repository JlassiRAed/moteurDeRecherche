 Simple aromatic rings also known as simple arenes or simple aromatics are aromaticity aromatic organic compound s They consist only of a conjugated system conjugated Plane Typical simple aromatic compounds are benzene indole and cyclotetradecaheptaene Simple aromatic rings with non carbon ring atoms are called heterocyclic For example rings can include oxygen nitrogen or sulfur Molecules with one ring are called monocyclic as in benzene Molecules with two rings are called bicyclic as in naphthalene Molecules with more than two rings are called polycyclic as in anthracene Simple monocyclic aromatic rings are usually five membered rings like pyrrole or six membered rings like pyridine Fused aromatic rings consist of monocyclic rings that share their connecting bonds TOC
