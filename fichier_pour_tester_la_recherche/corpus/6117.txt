In chemistry a substitution reaction happens when an atom or a group of atoms is replaced by a different one Substitution reactions can be of many different types In organic chemistry the main ones are nucleophilic substitution and electrophilic substitution These take their names from electrophile s and nucleophile s However substitution reactions can also happen under other conditions For example photochemistry photochemical reactions are used to put halogen s in a molecule Another example is using free radical s Choosing the correct solvent and temperature conditions is very important to make sure that the reaction happens Sometimes an elimination reaction can happen instead The product product of a substitution reaction is often called a substituted molecule For example phenol can be called a substituted benzene chem stub
