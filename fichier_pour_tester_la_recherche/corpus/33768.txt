 Musica ficta is a term used in Medieval music medieval and Renaissance music It means that when musicians play or sing music they put in accidental which are not written in the music In those days For example to go down from the note B to an F would have sounded bad so the F would need to be an F sharp The composer who wrote the music down might not bother to put the sign for F sharp He would expect the performer to know that it should be an F sharp and not an F This is what is called musica ficta Gradually it became more and more necessary for composers to write exactly what notes they wanted The modern system of keys was developing They developed the system of key signature s and accidentals The practice of musica ficta gradually ended
