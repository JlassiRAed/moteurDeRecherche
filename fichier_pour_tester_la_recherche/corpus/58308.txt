In cryptography linear cryptanalysis is a general form of cryptanalysis based on finding Affine transformation affine approximations to the action of a cipher Attacks have been developed for block cipher s and stream cipher s Linear cryptanalysis is one of the two most widely used attacks on block ciphers the other being differential cryptanalysis A variety of refinements to the attack have been suggested including using multiple Linear approximation linear approximations or including Nonlinear system non linear expressions Evidence of security against linear cryptanalysis is usually expected of new cipher designs
