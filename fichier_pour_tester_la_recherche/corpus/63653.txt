 Mechanics is a part of physics It says what happens when Force forces act on things There are two parts of mechanics The two parts are classical mechanics and quantum mechanics Classical mechanics is used most of the time for most of the things we can see Some of the time for example when the things are too small classical mechanics is not good Then we need to use quantum mechanics
