A volcanic plug is a landform created when volcano volcanic magma hardens inside a Volcanic vent vent on an active volcano They are sometimes called volcanic necks or puys The plug is revealed when surrounding land is erosion eroded As it forms a plug may cause an extreme build up of pressure if gas charged magma is trapped beneath it This sometimes leads to an explosive eruption But if the explosion does not occur then the volcano becomes a solid block made of hard material The plug is usually harder than the surrounding rock Glaciation Glacial erosion can lead to exposure of the plug on one side while a long slope of material remains on the lee side Such landforms are called crag and tail If a plug is preserved erosion may remove the surrounding rock while the erosion resistant plug remains This is what produces the distinctive upstanding landform
