The parabola first named it A parabola is a conic section If a cone is dissected by a Plane parallel to one of the surface s of the cone the result is a parabola The point where the parabola reaches its maximum or minimum is called the vertex At this point the curvature of the parabola is greatest Each parabola has a focal point Any ray that enters the parabola and is parallel to the axis of symmetry will pass through this point after being reflected by the curve Because of this fact parabolas are important in devices such as satellite dish es or magnifying mirror s Parabolas are often used to Approximation approximate curves that are more difficult to model by themselves Every parabola uses the equation File Bouncing ball strobe edit jpg The bouncing of a ball will be parabolic if friction is neglectedFile ParabolicWaterTrajectory jpg The course of the water in a fountain is parabolicFile St Louis Gateway Arch jpg The Gateway Arch in St Louis looks like it is shaped like a parabola but it is actually an inverted weighted catenary File Offset Schotelantenne jpg A satellite receiver is shaped like a parabola
