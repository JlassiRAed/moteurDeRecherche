 Gills are what fish amphibian s and some other animal s use to breathe in water They have feathery parts which cause water to move across the animal s body which contains dissolved oxygen after the animal has swallowed the water The oxygen is absorbed into the animal s blood causing carbon dioxide moves out of the animal s blood and into the water through the gills Fish and frog gills are hidden on the sides of their heads Shark s have many gills slits on their necks Baby salamander s have gills that stick out like leaves from their heads In mushroom s gills are the spore bearing structure in Agaricales agarics while fish and some young amphibians use them to get oxygen others breath Some insects that live in water have a plastron which is a kind of gill It is a patch of special hairs that keeps the water away from the insect s spiracle s This allows them to continue to take in oxygen and remove carbon dioxide while they are under water
