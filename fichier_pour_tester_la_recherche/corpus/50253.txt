 SN A was a supernova that was in a Large Magellanic Cloud small galaxy that is orbiting our Milky Way galaxy The supernova was light years away which means it happened years ago in when it was discovered It was close enough that scientists found neutrino s before the light came to Earth SN A is the only supernova that has been that close in modern times and was the brightest object seen from Earth in over years There have been many others that were closer but they were before scientists had the tools to help them understand what was happening
