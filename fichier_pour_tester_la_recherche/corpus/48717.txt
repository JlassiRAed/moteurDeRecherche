A Dyson sphere is an idea about a structure that surrounds a star first thought up by physicist Freeman Dyson and then used in some science fiction works There are at least three types of Dyson spheres A Dyson shell that is a solid structure and the inside could even become habitable if the sphere produces artificial gravity by spinning on itself It would be extremely difficult if not impossible to build A Dyson swarm which is not exactly a sphere but millions of smaller bodies wikt orbit orbiting the star and thus forming a more or less spherical structure around it The most physically realistic structure to built A Dyson bubble that is made up of small bodies structure such as a light sail around a star that keeps it centered because of solar wind stellar winds
