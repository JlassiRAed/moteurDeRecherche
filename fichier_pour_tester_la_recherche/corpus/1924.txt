A cloud chamber is a sealed box with a supersaturation supersaturated vapour of water or alcohol When a charged particle goes through it the vapour is ionization ionized The resulting ion s act as nuclei around which a mist forms from the vapour The high energies of alpha and beta particles mean that a trail is left by ions produced along the path of the charged particle These tracks have distinctive shapes When any uniform magnetic field is applied across the cloud chamber positively and negatively charged particles will curve in opposite directions according to the Lorentz force law The cloud chamber was invented by Charles Wilson a Scottish people Scottish physicist who received the Nobel Prize in Physics in for this work The first cloud chamber was made in The invention was used in the early days of atomic physics It is often called the Wilson chamber Since then a number of other types of particle detector s have been invented
