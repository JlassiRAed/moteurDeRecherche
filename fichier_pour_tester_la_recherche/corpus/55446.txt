An edit war happens when people do not agree on an article s content Instead of discussing it on the Wikipedia Talk page talk page they keep changing the article back and forth If this happens an Wikipedia Administrator administrator may Wikipedia Protection policy protect the page for a few days so that no one except administrators can change it This is so that everyone will have a chance to think about the article and come to a Wikipedia consensus consensus or compromise It is not a good idea to start or join an edit war The Wikipedian way is to talk about it and have all sides give their opinion If that does not work ask a Wikipedian who has not been working on the article to give their opinion
