In chemistry terms cracking is a process by which complicated organic compound organic molecule s by breaking their carbon carbon bonds How fast the cracking process is and how long it takes for the end products to form are very dependent on the temperature and any existing catalyst s Cracking also referred to as pyrolysis is the breakdown of a large alkane into smaller more useful alkanes and an alkene Cracking is used in petroleum to form light products such as Liquified petroleum gas LPG and gasoline It usually produces a short chain alkane and a long chain alkene
