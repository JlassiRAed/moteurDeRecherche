The Great Pyramid of Giza is a huge pyramid built by the Ancient Egypt ians It stands near Cairo Egypt It is the oldest of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World and the only one to remain mostly intact When it was built it was metres tall It was the tallest building in the world for over years The pyramid was built for Khufu an Egyptian pharaoh It was perhaps built by Khufu s vizier Hemiunu It is believed that it took about years to build and was completed around BC When it was built the Great Pyramid was covered by stones that formed a smooth outer surface Some of these stones can still be seen around the base Most of what can be seen of the pyramid now is its basic core of blocks of limestone and granite There have been many different theories to explain how the pyramid was built Most accepted building ideas are based on the idea of moving huge stones from a quarry and dragging and lifting them into place Scientists found that the Great Pyramids of Giza were not built by slave s but workers who were paid for working Their grave s were found near the pyramid in There are three known rooms or chambers inside the Great Pyramid The lowest chamber is cut into the rock on which the pyramid was built This chamber was not finished The other two chambers are higher up inside the pyramid They are called the Queen s Chamber and the King s Chamber but these are modern labels as we do not know how the Egyptians were going to use them The Great Pyramid has two passages one leading up and the other down It is the only Egyptian pyramid to have the two passages The Great Pyramid is part of a group of buildings called the Giza Necropolis This includes two mortuary temples in honour of Khufu One is close to the pyramid and one near the Nile There are three smaller pyramids for Khufu s wives Other buildings include an even smaller satellite pyramid and a raised causeway which joins the two temples There are other tombs called mastaba probably for other important people
