 Database normalisation is an approach to designing database s which was introduced by Edgar F Codd in the s Certain databases known as relational database model relational databases allow data to be stored in separate groups Each group is commonly called table To provide useful information these groups are connected to each other For example students could be stored in one group and classes in another group To show that a student is enrolled in a class a relationship is established from one group to the other A student could have a relationship to many classes each of which he or she would be enrolled in while a class would have a relationship to many students A traditional alternative is the flat file database where all of the data is grouped together like in a spreadsheet The problem with flat file databases is that they can have a lot of blank spaces and there is a lot of information that has to be repeated for each entry This means that the database is bigger than it has to be and it makes it more likely that the database will contain mistakes Relational databases by breaking the data into groups reduce the chance of data integrity mistakes happening and does not take up any more space than necessary But for it to work it needs to be well designed Database normalization is a method of designing good relational databases There are several normal forms each of which have rules which the database should be designed to meet Codd originally specified three sets of criteria that different databases must meet first second and third normal form If a relation meets a certain normal form it is not vulnerable to certain modifications that will affect data integrity The drawback of meeting such a set of criteria is usually that querying certain data from the database will become more difficult
