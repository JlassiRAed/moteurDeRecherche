 Electrolysis of water is the decomposition of water into oxygen and hydrogen gas This happens when an electric current being passed through the water This technique can be used to produce breath breathable oxygen or hydrogen fuel However that method is more expensive than the industry industrial way to produce hydrogen fuel from natural gas In pure water a redox redox reaction can be watched At the cathode a reduction happens and on the anode an oxidation Normally the reaction is balanced with either an acid or a base as shown in the equation s below the reduction at cathode H the oxidation at anode HThat two reactions are half reactions They are balanced with an acid Commonly hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid is used However the half reactions can also be balanced with a base for example with sodium hydroxide the reduction at cathode H the oxidation at anode OHCombining one pair of half reactions leads to an overall reaction which is then the decomposition of water into oxygen and hydrogen complete reaction H
