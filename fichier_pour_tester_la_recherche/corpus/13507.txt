The history of Europe means all the time when humans lived in the Europe an continent up to the present day The first evidence of Homo sapiens in Europe dates back to BC Europe s ancient history antiquity the Peace of Westphalia Treaty of Westphalia and the Glorious Revolution laid the basis for a new era of expansion and enlightenment The Industrial Revolution beginning in Great Britain allowed masses of people not just the rich to escape for the first time from lives of being always poor and barely able to afford either food or shelter The Balkans Balkan nations began to regain their independence from the Ottoman Empire After the Franco Prussian War Italy and Germany were formed each from groups of smaller countries which spoke the same language s in and Conflict spread across the globe in a chase for empire s where powerful countries turned less powerful ones into colonies until the search for a place in the sun ended with the outbreak in of the biggest war that had ever been fought up to that point in time referred to by people at the time as the Great War but now most often called World War I or the First World War In the desperation of war the Russian Revolution of Russian Revolution promised the people peace bread and land and led to the end of the Russian Empire and its replacement by the formation of the Soviet Union The defeat of Germany came at the price of economic destruction which was formally written into the Treaty of Versailles in where it was stated that the First World War had been entirely the fault of Germany and its allies and demanded that they pay back the entire amount the war had cost The Great Depression began in brought about in part by the economic problems caused by the attempt to force Germany to pay for the war and in part by trade restrictions countries put up between each other in an attempt to make their countries own goods less expensive and goods made in other countries more expensive caused millions of people around the world to lose their jobs and led to changes in government in many countries some by elections and some by revolutions The governments of these countries generally fell into two main groups those who believed in freedom and human rights and those who followed fascism These two deeply different views led to a Second World War which most people who write history feel began in Europe when Germany invaded Poland in but soon spread to most of the countries in the world and also took in wars which were already going on in other places most notably the war between Japan and China After this war Communism spread to Central and Eastern Europe including the relatively new Eastern European countries of Yugoslavia Bulgaria Romania Albania and in Asia North Vietnam and North Korea and slightly later to Cuba in the Carribean Sea very near to North America The conflict between the advocates of a capitalism capitalist economy and democratic political system and a communistic economy and political system led to the Cold War a forty year argument between the United States and the Soviet Union two of the countries which had worked together to win the Second World War and the two which had come out of it with the most powerful military forces and the allies of each Each country wanted to promote their type of government The Soviet Union wanted to spread communism and the United States wanted to spread capitalistic democracy People across the world feared a nuclear war because of the tension and the two countries each supported their friends in several proxy wars most notably in Korea and Vietnam Communism became less attractive when it became clear that it could promote economic growth less effectively than the capitalistic Western states and that it was not suited for a reform Then the United States was the only superpower left Europe signed a new European Union treaty of union which included European countries in
