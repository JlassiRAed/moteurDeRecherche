 Amino acids are the building blocks of protein s In eukaryotes there are standard amino acids out of which almost all proteins are made In biochemistry an amino acid is any molecule that has both amine About amino acids are known For animals the most important thing that amino acids do is to make proteins which are very long chains of amino acids Every protein has its own sequence of amino acids and that sequence makes the protein take different shapes and have different functions Amino acids are like the alphabet for proteins even though you only have a few letters if you connect them you can make many different sentences Nine of the standard amino acids are essential amino acids for humans They cannot be built from other chemical compound compounds by the human body and so must be taken in as food Others may be essential for some ages or medical conditions Essential amino acids may also differ between species Herbivore s have to get their essential amino acids from their diet which for some is almost entirely grass Ruminant s such as cow s get some amino acids via microbe s in the first two stomach chambers
