Hi This is my fifth Simple News article This time round it s about Spoken Pages user DefenseSupportParty DefenseSupportParty first talked about it at Simple Talk and off we were reading articles and VGA Stubs I really think it s a great idea and would like to thank DefenseSupportParty for talking about it I d like to invite any of you to get involved in this too All you have to do is read the page record it as an ogg file and upload it directly to SEWP Simple enough uh I plan to do the VGA article recordings first as well as their Main Page stubs I ll then go on to Good Articles After that some regular articles too but I d prefer them to have at least GA status to be sure they are correct To join just add your name Wikipedia Spoken article here Thanks March UTC
