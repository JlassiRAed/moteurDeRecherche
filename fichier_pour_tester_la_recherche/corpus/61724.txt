 Bracovirus The polydnaviruses The ichnoviruses occur in Ichneumon ichneumonid wasps and bracoviruses in Braconidae braconid wasps The genome of the virus is composed of multiple segments of double stranded DNA packed in capsid proteins and a double or single layer envelope The sequences are quite different between BV and IV suggesting that the two types evolved independently
