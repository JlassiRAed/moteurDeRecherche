A white dwarf is a compact star Their matter is squashed together Gravitation has pulled the atoms close together and stripped off their electrons The mass of a white dwarf s mass is similar to that of the Sun but its volume is similar to that of the Earth White dwarfs are the final stellar evolution evolutionary state of all stars whose mass is not high enough to become a neutron star Over of the stars in the Milky Way will become white dwarf stars The material in a white dwarf no longer undergoes fusion reaction s so the star has no source of energy It is not supported by the heat of fusion against gravitational collapse A star like our Sun will become a white dwarf when it has run out of fuel Near the end of its life it will go through a red giant stage and then lose most of its gas until what is left contraction contracts and becomes a young white dwarf
