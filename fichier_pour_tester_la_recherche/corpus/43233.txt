A composite number is a natural number of a particular kind Any natural number is equal to times itself If the number is equal to any other numbers multiplied then the number is a composite number The smallest composite number is because x is not a composite number Every other number is a prime number The prime numbers are the numbers other than which are not equal to m x n The smallest prime number is There is no largest prime number The next smallest prime numbers are and so on The way that the prime numbers occur is a difficult problem for mathematicians When a number is larger it is more difficult to know if it is a prime number One of the answers is the Prime number theorem One of the unsolved problems is Goldbach s conjecture
