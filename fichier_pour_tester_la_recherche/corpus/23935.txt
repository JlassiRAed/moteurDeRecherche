 The lift force lifting force or simply lift is the sum of all the Force forces on a body that force it to move perpendicular to the direction of flow The most common type of lift is that of a wing of an aircraft But there are many other common uses such as propeller s on both aircraft and boat s rotor s on helicopter s wikt fan fan blades sail s on sailboat s and wind turbine s While the common meaning of the term lift suggests an upwards action lift can be in any direction For instance for a sail the lift is horizontal and for the wing on a race car the lift is down There are a number of ways of explaining the production of lift some are more complicated than others some have been shown to be false The simplest explanation is that the wing deflects air downward and the Newton s laws of motion Third Law reaction pushes the wing up
