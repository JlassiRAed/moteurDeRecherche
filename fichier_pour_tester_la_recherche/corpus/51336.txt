The Coriolis effect is a Force force that is found in a rotation rotating object Gaspard Gustave de Coriolis first described the Coriolis effect in using mathematics The Coriolis effect can best be seen in hurricane s In the northern hemisphere or part of the earth they spin clockwise in the southern hemisphere they spin the other way This happens because the earth spins on its tilt One example of the Coriolis effect that is often described is that water flows down a drain in the opposite direction in the northern and southern hemispheres However in reality the force of the Coriolis effect is not strong enough to see in such a small amount of water
