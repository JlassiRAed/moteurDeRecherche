 Atomic orbitals are the places surrounding the Nucleus nucleus of an atom where the electrons are most likely to be at any given time It used to be believed that electrons behaved Bohr model similarly to the solar system where the nucleus is like the sun and the electron s orbit like the planet s However electrons do not go in circles they move in many different directions The number of atomic orbitals in an chemical element element is defined by the Periodic table period period the element is in Electrons move between orbitals depending on how fast they are moving and how many other electrons there are
