 Natural killer cells are a type of lymphocyte critical to the innate immune system NK cells provide a rapid response to cells infected by virus es or to bacterial cells The response happens about days after infection NK cells also respond to tumour formation NK cells are unique they have the ability to recognise stressed cells in the absence of antibodies and major histocompatibility complex This allows for a much faster immune reaction In early experiments in cancer patients and animals investigators found what was called a natural reactivity That is a certain population of cells seemed to be able to kill tumour cells without previously being sensitized to them At first many thought that these observations were artifacts However by natural killing activity was established across a wide variety of species and the existence of a separate line of cells with this ability was suggested
