 Shale is a fine grained sedimentary rock formed from mud The mud is a mix of flakes of clay mineral s and tiny fragments Mudstone s on the other hand are similar in composition but do not show the fissility Shales and mudrocks contain roughly percent of the organic matter in all sedimentary rocks However this amounts to less than one percent by mass in an average shale Black shales form in anoxic conditions They contain free carbon and iron sulfides such as pyrite This produces the black colouration
