A cyclotron is a type of particle accelerator invented by Ernest Lawrence from the University of California Berkeley in It accelerates charged particle s by whirling them in a circle The first cyclotrons were the size of a hand Some modern circular accelerators use a circle as wide as a city Cyclotrons use perpendicular magnetic field to bend electron s and particle s through into a semicircular path by an applied electric field The applied electric field accelerates electrons between the D electrodes of the magnetic field region The accelerating electric field reverses just at the time the electrons finish their half circle so that it accelerates them across the gap With a higher speed they move in a larger semicircle After repeating this process several times they come out the exit port at a high speed
