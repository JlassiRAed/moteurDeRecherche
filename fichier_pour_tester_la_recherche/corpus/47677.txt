First do not take offense if a page you submitted was deleted Most publishers maintain the right to reject articles that for some reason do not fit their purposes Keep in mind Simple English is a separate and unique Wikipedia project with its own guidelines and policies While in some ways it is similar to the larger English Wikipedia it is not the same Many editors here have had articles deleted before and most see it as a learning experience C S Lewis the author of The Chronicles of Narnia and resubmit the article You may want to ask another editor for help While Simplewiki is a small community and most editors are kept very busy with work of their own most will take the time to help new editors who have questions or would like to know how to do something Remember this is about the article not the editor
