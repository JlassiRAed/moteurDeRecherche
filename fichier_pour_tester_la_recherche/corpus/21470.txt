The Kyshtym disaster was a radiation contamination disaster which happened on September in Mayak a nuclear plant in Russia Mayak is the name for a number of nuclear facilities which are about from Ekaterinburg in Russia The facilities were also known as Chelyabinsk or Chelyabinsk Mayak was built between and It was the first plant that could produce nuclear energy nuclear material in the Soviet Union At times up to people worked at Mayak They produced the plutonium fuel that was used for the first Soviet atomic bomb amongst other things Between and a total of ten nuclear reactors were built Until all but two were closed The two remaining produce radioactive decay radioactive isotope s for health care and for research purposes During different accidents a large amount of radioactivity was wikt released released into the environment The biggest of these accidents happened in and is known as Kyshtym Disaster today It happened in a plant near Kishtim There were many accidents in this secret plant At least people died from radiation sickness About people were evacuation evacuated from their homes More than people were affected by the radiation without knowing it During the next ten to eleven hours the radioactive cloud moved towards the northeast reaching between and kilometers from the accident The fallout of the cloud resulted in a long term contamination of an area of more than square kilometers mostly with caesium and strontium Today the area is known as the East Ural Radioactive Trace The existence of Mayak was a secret Only very few people knew it was there For this reason the people living in the areas affected by the accident were not told about the accident On th October a week after the accident the authority authorities started to evacuate about people but they did not tell about the reason for the evacuation People grew hysterical with fear because unknown mysterious diseases were breaking out Victim s were seen with skin sloughing off their faces hands and other exposed parts of their bodies It was Zhores Medvedev who revealed the nature and extent of the disaster to the world Even though the Soviet Union Soviet government hid information about the figures it is known that the direct exposure to radiation caused at least cases of death from cancer To reduce the spread of radioactive contamination after the accident contaminated soil was removed and kept in fenced enclosures that were called graveyards of the earth In the Soviet government disguised the EURT area by creating the East Ural Nature Reserve which prohibited any unauthorised access to the affected area Rumours of a nuclear mishap somewhere in the vicinity of Chelyabinsk had long been circulating in the West That there had been a serious nuclear accident west of the Urals was eventually inferred from research on the effects of radioactivity on plants animals and ecosystems published by Professor Leo Tumerman former head of the Biophysics Laboratory at the Institute of Molecular Biology in Moscow and associates According to Gyorgy According to different sources the amount of radioactivity produced by this disaster is between twice and six times that of Chernobyl disaster of Because the leakage was more limited this is classified as a Level disaster on the International Nuclear Event Scale Chernobyl is rated at Level In Russian authorities closed down the Mayak plant Lake Karachay which is close to the plant is seen as one of the most contamination contaminated spots on the planet In the past years about half a million people in the region have been irradiated in one or more of the incidents Some of them were exposed to more than twenty times the radiation suffered by the Chernobyl disaster effects victims
