 Heinrich events occurred during the coldest point of Bond Cycles in which many iceberg s were discharged into the North Atlantic and melted Evidence for this can be found in the north Atlantic sediment core sample core s which show poorly sorted angular and contain rocks These were originally in the icebergs but dropped to the bottom of the ocean when the icebergs melted Heinrich events are a possible trigger to the onset of mini ice age s which follow a long period of thaw An example might be the Younger Dryas a brief cold period from about thousand years ago to about thousand years ago The Younger Dryas stadial is thought to have been caused by the collapse of the North American ice sheets although rival theories have been proposed
