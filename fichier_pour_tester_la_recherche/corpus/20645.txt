 Thermodynamics is a branch of physics that studies the movement of heat between different objects Thermodynamics also studies the change in pressure and volume of objects A branch of Mathematics math called statistics is often used in thermodynamics to look at the motion of particle s Thermodynamics is useful because it helps us understand how the world of the very small atoms connects to the large scale world we see everyday Thermodynamics also has two main branches called classical thermodynamics and Statistical mechanics statistical thermodynamics An important idea in thermodynamics is that of a thermodynamic system An example of a thermodynamic system is a brick A brick is made up of many atoms which all have their own properties All thermodynamic systems have two kinds of properties extensive and intensive For the brick the extensive properties are the ones you get by adding up all the atoms Things like the volume energy mass and charge are extensive because two of the same brick put together have twice as much mass as one brick The intensive properties of the brick are the ones you get by looking at the average over all atoms Things like temperature pressure and density are intensive because two of the same brick still has the same temperature as one brick alone
