In Greek mythology Pandora s box was a large Container jar carried by Pandora It contained the evils to be let loose on mankind When the box was empty hope remained The actual evils are not specified by Hesiod Although in Hesiod s Works and Days these actual evils are not specified by name except for Hope See text line beginning with line And Epimetheus did not think on what Prometheus had said to him bidding him never take a gift of Olympian Zeus but to send it back for fear it might prove to be something harmful to men But he took the gift and afterward when the evil thing was already his he understood For ere this the tribes of men lived on earth remote and free from ills and hard toil and heavy sicknesses which bring the Fates upon men for in misery men grow old quickly But the woman took off the great lid of the jar with her hands and scattered all these and her thought caused sorrow and mischief to men Only Hope remained there in an unbreakable home within under the rim of the great jar and did not fly out at the door for ere that the lid of the jar stopped her by the will of Aegis holding Zeus who gathers the clouds But the rest countless plagues wander amongst men for earth is full of evils and the sea is full Of themselves diseases come upon men continually by day and by night bringing mischief to mortals silently for wise Zeus took away speech from them So is there no way to escape the will of Zeus
