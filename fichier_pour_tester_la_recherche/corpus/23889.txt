 Checkpoint Charlie was one of three places where people could travel from the Western occupied sectors of Germany and Berlin to the Soviet occupied sectors These places were called checkpoints because they were places where passports and identities were checked As it was the only crossing point there were sometimes queues of people waiting to cross But military traffic was never stopped because Berlin was supposed to be under the control of all four wartime allies
