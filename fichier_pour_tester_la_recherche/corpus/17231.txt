The Mediterranean Ridge is a wide ridge in the Bed floor of the Mediterranean Sea It is next to a rough quarter circle from Calabria south of Crete to the southwest corner of Turkey and from there eastwards south of Turkey with Cyprus From what Plate tectonics tectonic theory says it is caused by the African Plate subduction subducting under the Eurasian Plate Eurasian and Anatolian Plate Anatolian Plate tectonics plates As the African Plate moves slowly north northeastward it Plowing plows up the floor of the Mediterranean lifting it from the seabed and then above sea level making the island of Cyprus If the continental drift northward movement of Africa continues the Ridge might grow into a long and high mountain range and destroy the Mediterranean Sea
