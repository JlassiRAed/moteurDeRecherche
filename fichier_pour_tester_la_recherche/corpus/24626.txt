 Latino Moderne is a language that was made by David Shark David Th Stark in the s and first published on the internet in It is a revision of the grammar of the IALA s language Interlingua using the IALA s words with little change Applying the same principles that were used in developing the international vocabulary for Interlingua to developing a grammar L M restores personal endings on its verbs and has gender and number agreement between its nouns and their adjectives and articles The language also has an more clearly developed system for showing case distinctions in its pronouns This in effect frees L M from a dependence on word order as is found in Interlingua The changes in L M actually are very simple and easy to learn providing a much more poetic and free use of it for international communication Most of the changes that L M makes to the IALA language are actually suggestions that were set forth by the original deverlopers of the IALA project Properly speaking L M should be viewed as a continuation to the IALA project not as something in competition with it It is hoped that the spread and use of Latino Moderne may assist in solving some of the communication problems that exist in the European Union and throughout the modern world In this respect it shares the same goals as Interlingua Esperanto etc The developer of the language hopes that L M will be received and used as a suggested model language to help promote better international communication and friendship among nations
