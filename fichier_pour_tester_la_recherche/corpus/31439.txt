A gas compressor is a mechanical device that increases the pressure of a gas by reducing its volume Compression of a gas naturally increases its temperature Compressors are similar to pump s both increase the pressure on a fluid and both can transport the fluid through a pipe pipe As gases are compressible the compressor also reduces the volume of a gas Liquids are relatively incompressible so the main action of a pump is to transport liquids
