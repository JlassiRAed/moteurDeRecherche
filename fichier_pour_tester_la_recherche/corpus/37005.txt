In computer network s a proxy server is a server use to access other computers Proxy servers get their name because they act like a wikt proxy proxy and act on behalf of a Client s computer A client that connects to the proxy server requests some service such as a file connection web page or other resource that is available on a different server The proxy server then goes to the other server and requests what the client wants for them A proxy server can change the information that it gives to the client and if the same information is accessed many times or by many different clients it can use what is called a cache to make things faster A cache is the term for information that has been accessed and saved for future use if a proxy server has what the client is accessing in its cache it will make it faster because it does not need to go and access the other server to provide what the client wants A proxy server can be placed anywhere in the connection between the client and the server which could include software on the client computer itself or on any computer between Some proxy servers use Secure Sockets Layer to secure the connection between the client and the remote server This security layer helps to make sure that no other computers can read or understand what the client is asking from the server
