A supernova is when a huge star explodes It usually happens when its nuclear fusion cannot hold the core against its own gravity The core collapses and explodes The biggest supernovae are called hypergiant s and smaller ones are called supergiant s They are mass ive because of gravity they use up their energy very quickly Normally they only live for a few million years During the explosion the total energy radiated by supernovae may briefly outshine the entire output of a galaxy They emission emit energy equal to that of the whole lifetime of a solar like star Heger Alexander et al How massive single stars end their life Astrophysical Journal This drives a shock wave into the surrounding interstellar medium This sweeps up an expanding shell of gas and dust which we see as a supernova remnant After exploding what is left becomes a black hole or a neutron star Most stars are small and do not explode They become colder and smaller and they become white dwarf stars Supernova explosions happen rarely In our own galaxy the Milky Way the last supernova happened in the year We can see supernovas in other galaxies too Every year we see supernovas in other galaxies because there are so many galaxies Sometimes they are brighter than the whole rest of the galaxy
