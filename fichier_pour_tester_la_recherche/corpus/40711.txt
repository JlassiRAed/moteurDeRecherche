In the mathematician David Hilbert published a list of unsolved mathematical problems The list of problems turned out to be very influential After Hilbert s death another problem was found in his writings this is sometimes known as Hilbert s th problem today This problem is about finding criteria to show that a solution to a problem is the simplest possible Of the problems three were unresolved in three were too vague to be resolved and six could be partially solved Given the influence of the problems the Clay Mathematics Institute formulated a similar list called the Millennium Prize Problems in
