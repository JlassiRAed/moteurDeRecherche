A conductor is a material which electricity heat or sound can flow through An electrical conductor conducts electricity The ability to conduct electricity is called electrical conductivity Most metal s like iron and copper are electrical conductors These metals are used to make wires to carry electric current Plasma Plasma is an excellent conductor of electricity and is used for many purposes but metals are more used Some materials are semiconductor s This means that electricity can flow through them but not very well Some materials are resistors This means that they make it very hard for electricity to flow through them A material that stops electric current is called an insulator Wire s are covered with insulators like plastic to stop the electricity from leaving the wire Some materials when really cold are superconductor s They offer no resistance at all to the flow of electricity
