A topological space is a space studied in topology the mathematics of the structure of shapes Roughly it is a set of things along with a way to know which things are close together More precisely a topological space has a certain kind of set called open sets Open sets are important because they allow one to talk about points near another point called a neighbourhood of the point A neighbourhood of a point is simply an open set containing that point If one did not have the concept of open sets one cannot define neighbourhoods in a good way If one tries to define a neighbourhood of a point as any set containing that point it might just include that point and that point only not any points near it or points far away We also have the concept of closed sets which are complements of open sets That is all of the points not belonging to a certain open sets forms a closed set Open sets must follow certain rules so that they match our ideas of nearness The Union As a special case the set containing every point is both open and closed A set of points can have many different definitions of what an open set is One can think of only certain sets as open or more sets as open One might even consider every set to be open The same set with different definitions of open sets form different topological spaces
