A Wide Area Network or WAN is made up of several computer network s connected together often over the Internet In most cases the networks in WANs all belong to the same company or school WANs are used to connect LANs and other types of networks together so that users and computers in one location can communicate with users and computers in other locations Many WANs are built for one particular organization and are private Others built by Internet service provider s provide connections from an organization s LAN to the Internet WANs are often built using leased lines At each end of the leased line a router connects to the LAN on one side and a hub within the WAN on the other Leased lines can be very expensive Instead of using leased lines WANs can also be built using less costly circuit switching or packet switching methods Network protocols including TCP IP deliver transport and addressing functions Protocols including Packet over SONET SDH MPLS ATM and Frame relay are often used by service providers to deliver the links that are used in WANs X was an important early WAN protocol and is often considered to be the grandfather of Frame Relay as many of the underlying protocols and functions of X are still in use today by Frame Relay Academic research into wide area networks can be broken down into three different areas mathematical model s network emulation and network simulation Performance improvements are sometimes delivered via WAFS or WAN optimization
