Morgan s canon is a rule relating to animal behaviour which states that it should be explained as simply as possible It is named after British psychologist C Lloyd Morgan His idea was that people should only consider behaviour as for example rational purposive or affectionate if there is no other explanation possible In no case is an animal activity to be interpreted in terms of higher psychological processes if it can be fairly interpreted in terms of processes which stand lower in the scale of psychological evolution and development Morgan saw that much wikt insight insight and apparent problem solving behaviour could be described using trial and error learning A famous example is the skilful way in which Morgan s terrier Tony opened the garden gate easily taken by someone seeing the final behaviour as an insightful act Morgan however had watched and recorded the series of approximations by which the dog had gradually learned the response and could demonstrate that no insight was required to explain it Morgan s Canon is a forerunner of behaviourism
