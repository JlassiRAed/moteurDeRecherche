 Carrier Sense Multiple Access protocol When Transmitter transmitting on a Media medium that is shared by many transmitters the transmitter first checks to see that nothing else is already transmitting Examples of shared transmission medium include an electrical bus or part of the electromagnetic spectrum Carrier Sense means that a transmitter uses feedback from a receiver to know if the medium is already in use before trying to send That is it tries to find a signal from another station before trying to transmit If a signal is found the station waits for that transmission to end before starting its own transmission Multiple Access means that many stations send and receive on the medium Transmissions are usually received by all other stations using the medium
