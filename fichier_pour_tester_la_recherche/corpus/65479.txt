 Sujebi is a traditional Korean cuisine Korean soup It is a Korean style pasta soup consisting of hand torn dough flakes with various vegetables and has been eaten from the early Goryeo period In ancient times when the Korea people were poor they didn t have much foodstuffs and so made sujebi with small quantity of dough and leftover vegetables In addition rice was rare after the Korean War so many people ate sujebi instead of rice because wheat flour was cheaper at that time However sujebi with various kinds of ingredients was considered a special food so it was eaten on special days like a celebration day or Meal feast Nowadays there are many kinds of sujebi and many people enjoy it as a health food It is similar to another Korean traditional food Kalguksu but Kalsuksu is made with noodles while sujebi is made with wheat flakes Both of them are considered as proper food for a rainy day due to its hot and rich flavored broth It is usually eaten with kimchi
