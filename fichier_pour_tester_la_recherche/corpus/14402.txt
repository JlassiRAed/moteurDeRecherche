A village is a place where people live normally in the countryside It is usually larger than a Hamlet hamlet and smaller than a town or city In some places it may be a kind of local government The dwellings in a village are clustered fairly close to one another not scattered broadly over the landscape In the past villages were where most people lived Villages were a usual form of community for societies that do subsistence agriculture and for some non agricultural societies After the industrial revolution when people started making a lot of things in factories people lived more in towns Moving to towns is called urbanization When villages grow a lot they can grow into towns and then cities This is what happened to Dubai and Chicago
