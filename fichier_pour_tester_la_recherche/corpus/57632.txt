A chosen ciphertext attack is an attack model for cryptanalysis in which the cryptanalyst gathers information at least in part by choosing a ciphertext and obtaining its decryption under an unknown key When a cryptosystem is susceptible to chosen ciphertext attack implementers must be careful to avoid situations in which an attackers might be able to decrypt chosen ciphertexts Optimal Asymmetric Encryption Padding RSA OAEP Cramer Shoup system Cramer Shoup and many forms of Authentication authenticated Symmetric key algorithm symmetric encryption
