A gas is one of the four most common states of matter In a gas the molecule s move freely and are wikt independent independent of each other This makes it different from a liquid where the molecules are loosely attached It is also different from a solid where the bonds are strong and hold the molecules together In a pure gas each molecule may be made of an individual atom It may be elemental where each molecule is made of more than one of the same atom bound together It may be chemical compound compounds where molecules are made of many types of atoms together An example of a monoatomic gas is neon an example of an elemental gas is hydrogen and an example of a compound gas is carbon dioxide A gas mixture contains a mix of any of the above types for example air which is nitrogen oxygen and argon and carbon dioxide Poison gas es were used as chemical weapon s in World War I but were later banned
