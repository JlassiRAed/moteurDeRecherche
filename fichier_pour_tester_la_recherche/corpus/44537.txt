 Fourier analysis is a branch of analysis that looks at how more complex function functions can be built with simpler ones It is also known as classical harmonic analysis It is named after Joseph Fourier who first used it in the th century The process itself is called Fourier transform Fourier analysis is widely used in fields such as physics partial differential equation s number theory combinatorics signal processing imaging probability theory statistics option pricing cryptography numerical analysis acoustics oceanography sonar optics diffraction geometry and protein structure analysis
