A thermodynamic cycle is a series of thermodynamic process es which returns a system to its initial state Properties depend only on the thermodynamic state and thus do not change over a cycle Variables such as heat and work work are not zero over a cycle but rather depend on the process The first law of thermodynamics dictates that the net heat input is equal to the net work output over any cycle The repeating nature of the process path allows for continuous operation making the cycle an important concept in thermodynamics If the cyclic process moves clockwise around the loop then it represents a heat engine and W will be positive If it moves counterclockwise then it represents a heat pump and W will be negative
