The hypotenuse is the side opposite the degree degrees angle in a right triangle It is always the longest side For example In this triangle if angle C is degrees then the opposite side c is the hypotenuse The hypotenuse is important in trigonometry where it is used to calculate many function functions The length of the hypotenuse can be calculated if the other two sides are known using Pythagoras Theorem In fact the length of any side of a right triangle can be calculated if the other two sides are known using this theorem
