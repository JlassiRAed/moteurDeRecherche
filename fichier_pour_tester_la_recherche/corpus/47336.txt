In mathematics a function is a prescription that assigns to every object of one set an object of another to represent the three parts of the function the domain the codomain and the pairing process An example of a function is the factorial The idea of a function has been set up to cover all sorts of possibilities It is not necessary that the pairing is given by an equation The main idea is that inputs and outputs are paired up somehow even if the process is very complicated or not obvious
