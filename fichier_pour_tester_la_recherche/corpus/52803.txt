A Smoke sensor or Smoke detector is a device that can detect smoke which may be an indicator of a fire There are two basic systems Simple standalone sensors usually make a sound or flash a light when they detect smoke More sophisticated sensors usually send a signal to an fire alarm panel or system Most smoke detectors use either an optics optical sensor or they use a physical process called ionization Many simple smoke sensors use battery batteries Very often dead batteries are not replaced when this happens the smoke sensors stop working But the detector may chirp when the battery is low to try and stop this from happening There are also systems which are directly connected to electrical power these may use batteries just as a backup
