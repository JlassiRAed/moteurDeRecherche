 Nucleoplasm is the contents of the cell nucleus It is the protoplasm inside the nuclear membrane It includes many smaller molecules and water large molecules such as enzymes of many types and nucleotides larger organelle s such as the chromosomes and the nucleoli A network of nucleolar channels makes a continuous chain between the nucleoplasm and the inner parts of the nucleolus Ribosomes made in the nucleolus get sent to the endoplasmic reticulum in the cytoplasm The main role of the nucleoplasm is to keep the chromosomes separate from the cell cytoplasm and support the translation translating of DNA to RNA
