 Acrocanthosaurus was a genus of theropod dinosaur that lived in North America during the Lower Cretaceous period Its name means high spined lizard This refers to the spines on its vertebrae which formed a sail or hump when the animal was alive Its classification is uncertain It was originally classified as a spinosaur because the spines on its back looked like those of Spinosaurus However Acrocanthosaurus is now classified as a carnosaur Most paleontologists believe that it was a carcharodontosaurid Acrocanthosaurus was feet long almost as large as Tyrannosaurus rex and weighed about or short ton s It was the largest theropod in North America before the evolution of the tyrannosaurs Long low ridges start at the nasal bones They run along each side of the wikt snout snout from the nostril back to the eye and they continued onto the lacrimal bone s There is a famous trackway in Paluxy Texas which shows tracks of what might be an Acrocanthosaurus and its prey While interesting and plausible this hypothesis is difficult to prove and there are other explanations
