The C programming language is a computer programming language that was developed to do system programming for the operating system UNIX and is an imperative programming imperative programming language C was developed in the early by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie It is a procedural language which means that people can write their computer program programs as a series of step by step instructions C is a compiled language Because the ideas behind C are kept close to the design of the computer the compiler can generate machine code instructions for the computer that will run very fast It is fast because it builds the program in machine code native code This makes C a good language for writing operating system s Many operating systems including Linux and UNIX are programmed using this language The language itself has very few keywords and most things are done using programming library libraries which are collections of code for them to be reused C is available for many different types of computers This is why C is called a portable language portable language A program that is written in C and that respects certain limitations can be compiled for many different platforms The syntax of C has also influenced many other programming languages such as C C Sharp Java and many more programming languages we use nowadays
