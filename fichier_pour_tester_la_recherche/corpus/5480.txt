Greetings readers of the Simple English Wikipedia s Simple News I ve not written a Simple News article for a while and indeed have been slacking off on my Simple News duties Unfortunately I have had my GCSE exams but they are now over and i m back to normal activity levels which also means that Simple News will be back up to it s old standards but that is only if you guys help and send things in Anything is appreciated Secondly i d like to make an addendum to the last Issue of Simple News when a couple of errors managed to creep in to the Issue These were found in the QandA section which made out the User Kennedy Kennedy was still retired and the other was in the announcements when a Very was omitted from the list of articles that were at VGA Simple Pedia has very much been on a slow down recently and we need to try to get back up to our activity levels from a few months ago when we frequently had or PGAs at the relevant page as I write this we have PVGA and PGAs I ve got a couple of articles i m working on myself and hope to have at least one of these on the PVGA page before the end of this week Time will tell With us now being about half way through i ve also had a look back at the predictions that I made in our Wikipedia Simple News Special Edition I must say some of them were pretty accurate Crich Tramway Village has made it to WP VGA VGA status the flood flag has been enabled and GBots and have both been brought online albeit with some problems and not as was originally intended There have also been no less than Sysop promotions of which one was mine and one was a re promotion Bureaucrat promotions and CheckUser promotions In addition there has been one re confirmation and one de sysopping So what holds for the rest of Only time can tell but with the th article mark getting closer Simple is certainly not a small and pointless wiki Finally with regards to my current signature let me make it known that I do not love Kennedy in the way that many have been thinking It is merely a token of our good friendship and how much his prescence on this wiki means to me and a lot of other editors I hope you all have a brilliant summer center
