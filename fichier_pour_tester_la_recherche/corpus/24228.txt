The Upper Cretaceous is the last geology geological Epoch epoch in the Cretaceous It began million years ago and ended million years ago The Cretaceous is traditionally divided into Lower Cretaceous rocks The rocks reflect the conditions in which they were formed The Upper Cretaceous is the chalk It is composed of countless millions of Calcium carbonate calcareous plates called coccolith s They are so small they can only just be seen with a light microscope details require an electron microscope The plates are formed by single celled plankton ic algae called coccolithophore s and were laid down in the off shore seas The only other rock found in chalk is the flint which is Silicon dioxide siliceous This derives from those algae and animals which have skeletons of silica The Cretaceous was the last period when dinosaur s were the dominant land animals Triceratops Tyrannosaurus and Velociraptor lived at this time The huge Mosasaurus was the dominant Ocean marine predator In the Cretaceous period bird s became more wikt diverse diverse Flowering plants developed more and became the dominant plants on land The Upper Cretaceous ended with the K T extinction event
