A right of veto means that somebody can stop decision s or legislation For example the President of the United States has veto power over the USA s United States Congress Congress This can stop legislation from being passed If the President vetoes a bill passed by the Congress it only becomes a law if Congress passes it again this time with at least twice as many members of each of the two houses voting for it than voting against it Similarly the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council each has veto power Using this they can stop the Security Council s decisions from being passed and becoming resolutions unless they all agree to them These vetoes cannot be overturned by any more voting on that resolution if there is a need to address the same issue again in the future a new and separate resolution must be written passed and not vetoed The veto was invented in ancient times for the Roman tribune s so they could protect the people from bad laws made by the Roman Senate
