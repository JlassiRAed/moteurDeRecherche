 Knowledge means the things which are true as opposed to opinion Information which is correct is knowledge Knowledge can always be supported by evidence If a statement is not supported by evidence then it is not knowledge The evidence makes it justified it is not an opinion or a guess Knowledge can refer to a theoretical or practical understanding of a subject This was the point of Ryle s distinction between knowing that and knowing how In philosophy the study of knowledge is called epistemology The philosopher Plato defined knowledge as justified true belief This definition is the subject of the Gettier problems All knowledge is a claim to be true but the claim can be incorrect The only claims which are certainly true are circular based on how we use words or terms We can correctly claim that there are degrees in a circle since that is part of how circles are defined The point of Aristotle s syllogism was to show that this kind of reasoning had a machine like form If all swans are white and this is a swan then it must be white But actually in the real world not all swans are white The most widely accepted way to find reliable knowledge is the scientific method Yet one thing all philosophy of science philosophers of science agree is that there is that scientific knowledge is just the best we can do at any one time All scientific knowledge is provisional not a claim of absolute truth
