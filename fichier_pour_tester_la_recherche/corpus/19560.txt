 Hysteresis is a concept in physical science In hysteresis the output of a system depends not only on its input but also on its history of past inputs This is because the history affects the value of an internal state To predict the future outputs of a system either its internal state or its history must be known The effect may happen because of a lag between input and output This effect disappears as the input changes more slowly This effect meets the description of hysteresis given above but is often referred to as rate dependent hysteresis to distinguish it from hysteresis with a more durable memory effect Hysteresis occurs in ferromagnetic materials and ferroelectricity ferroelectric materials Many artificial systems are designed to have hysteresis for example in thermostat s and computers
