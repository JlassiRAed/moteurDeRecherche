An NP hard problem is a yes no problem where finding a solution for it is at least as hard finding a solution for the hardest problem who s solution can quickly be checked as being true Some NP hard problems are ones where a working solution can be checked quickly and some are not NP hard problems that are also NP problems fit into a category called NP complete An example of a problem that is at least as hard to solve as any other problem that we can quickly check solutions for which is also quickly checkable A travelling salesman wants to visit cities by driving starting and ending his trip at home He has a limited supply of gasoline so he can only drive a total of kilometers He wants to know if he can visit all of the cities without running out of gasoline People don t know how to solve this problem faster than testing every possible answer but if a solutions is found that allows the salesman to do this we can can use an algorithm check that it is true An example of a problem that is at least as hard to solve as any other problem that we can quickly check solutions for but that can not be checked quickly if someone starts a program that simply goes while continue and never stops it will it run forever There is no known way to find a solution to this and this also cannot be checked INDEX
