 The following discussion is preserved as an Help Archiving a talk page archive The result is successful which means Kennedy s sysop and bureaucrat flags are revoked I am making a request to remove them via Meta Kennedy may reapply for these rights via the standard RfA and RfB processes While there is some disagreement as to whether or not both flags should be removed the administrator bit is just as much a position of community trust as bureaucrat is there is a fairly strong consensus among editors that the community s trust in this editor has been broken As a result I am making the decision to remove sysop rights in addition to bureaucrat rights ndash January
