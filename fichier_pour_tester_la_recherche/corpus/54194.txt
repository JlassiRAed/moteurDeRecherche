 Serpent is a Symmetric key algorithm symmetric key block cipher which was the second finalist in the Advanced Encryption Standard Advanced Encryption Standard Competition contest after Rijndael key schedule Rijndael Serpent was designed by Ross Anderson Eli Biham and Lars Knudsen Serpent has a block size block size of bits and supports a key size of or bits The cipher is a round substitution permutation network operating on a block of four bit words Each round applies one of eight bit to bit Substitution box S boxes times in parallel Serpent was designed so that all operations can be executed in parallel computing parallel using bit slices This maximizes parallelism but also allows use of the extensive cryptanalysis work performed on Data Encryption Standard DES Serpent was widely viewed as a more traditional approach to security than the other AES finalists choosing a larger security margin the designers Estimation estimated rounds to be sufficient against known types of attack but specified rounds as insurance against future wikt progress progress in cryptanalysis The Serpent cipher has not been patent ed It is completely placed in the public domain and can be freely used by anyone
