 The Higgs field is an energy field that is thought to exist everywhere in the universe The field is accompanied by a fundamental particle called the Higgs boson which the field uses to continuously interact with other particles As particles pass through the field they are given mass and similar to an object passing through treacle will become slower and cannot travel at the speed of light because they have mass Mass itself is not generated by the Higgs field the creation of matter or energy would conflict with the laws of conservation However mass is given to particles from the Higgs field via the Higgs bosons which contain the relative mass in the form of energy Once the field has endowed a formerly massless particle the particle slows down because it has become heavier If the Higgs field did not exist particles would not have the mass required to attract one another and would float around freely at light speed Also gravity would not exist because mass would not be there to attract other mass The process of giving a particle mass is known as the Higgs effect This effect will transfer mass or energy to any particle that passes through it Light that passes through it gains energy not mass because it is a wave
