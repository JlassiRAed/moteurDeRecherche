 The normal distribution is a probability distribution It is also called Gaussian distribution because it was discovered by Carl Friedrich Gauss The normal distribution is a continuous probability distribution It is very important in many fields of science Normal distributions are a family of distributions of the same general form These distributions differ in their location and scale parameter s the mean defines the scale The standard normal distribution It is often called the bell curve because the graph of its probability density function probability density looks like a bell Many values follow a normal distribution This is because of the central limit theorem which says that if an event is the sum of other random events it will be normally distributed Some examples include Measurement errors Light intensity Intelligence is probably normally distributed There is a problem with accurately defining or measuring it though Insurance companies use normal distributions to model certain average cases
