A thermoplastic is a material usually a plastic polymer which becomes soft when heated and hard when cooled Thermoplastic materials can be cooled and heated several times without any change in their chemistry or mechanical properties When thermoplastics are heated they melt to a liquid They freeze to a glassy state when cooled enough Thermoplastic materials have many features Some products made from thermoplastic materials are used for electronics electronic applications They protect against electrostatic discharge and radio frequency interference Thermoplastics are one of the main two types of plastic s Thermoplastic can be moulding moulded into any shape Thermoplastics differ from  thermosetting polymer s Thermosets form irreversible  chemical bonds  during the curing curing process Polyvinyl chloride is the second largest volume thermoplastic produced Polypropylene is the most produced
