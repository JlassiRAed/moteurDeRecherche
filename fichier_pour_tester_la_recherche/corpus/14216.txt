There are two ways that natural and man made things can use rotation to move around One way is for the entire thing to wikt roll roll The other way is for part of the thing to turn while the rest does not like a wheel or a propeller Some living things move around by rolling but no living things seem to use wheels Biologist s have written about the reasons for this Wheels are a very useful technology for people Many technologies that people use are also found in nature like wing s and lens lenses It may seem strange then that wheels have never evolution evolved in nature but there are two reasons for this First there are natural limits to what kinds of things can exist in nature Living things change slowly over time a process called evolution by natural selection This process can create many different answers to a problem but it can t always create every answer that can be imagined Also the ways that new living things build themselves can t always create every kind of part that can be imagined Second wheels are sometimes less useful than other ways of moving like walk ing running or slithering like a snake
