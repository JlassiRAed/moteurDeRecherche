 Multi criteria optimization or multiobjective optimization is a way of solving a mathematical or economic problem where many different parameter s need to be changed to get one of the best possible solutions to the problem The result of this is called Pareto efficiency named after Vilfredo Pareto who first used it in his studies In economics the idea of Pareto efficiency is very simple If there is no way of improving the situation of one person without making that of another person worse the solution found is Pareto efficient If we look at what the economy produces we might say it is on its Pareto Frontier or Production Possibility Frontier meaning that it is making If this is the case making more of one thing would mean making less of another the resources are already being used to full capacity so making more of one thing will take resources away from making another Just because something is Pareto efficient it doesn t mean it is fair or equitable Even though no one could be made better off without making someone else worse off it is possible that one person owns all of the world s things To make anyone else better off some would have to be taken away from this person making them worse off
