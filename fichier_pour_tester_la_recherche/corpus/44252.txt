 Mole is the SI unit of measurement used to measure the number of things usually atom s or molecule s One mole of something is equal to Avogadro s number The measurement of Avogadro s number was refined in to We use this number because it is the number of carbon atoms in grams of carbon which is the most common isotope kind of carbon We can measure anything in moles but it is not very useful for most things because the numbers are so big For example one mole of grapefruits would be as big as the earth The number does not lend itself to easy expression in words The nearest casual number is one million million million million which is Because different molecules and atoms do not have the same mass one mole of one thing does not weigh the same as one mole of something else Atoms and molecule mass is measured in atomic mass unit u One u is equal to one gram per mole This means that if an atom has a mass of one u one mole of this atom weighs one gram
