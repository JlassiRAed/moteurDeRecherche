 Parasitoids are parasites whose larvae develop inside another organism s body This usually results in the death of the Host host which sets them apart from traditional parasites There are twelve Superfamily superfamilies of parasitic wasps which are entirely or mainly parasitoid The largest family are the ichneumon s with over species In parasitoids the adult stage is free living it finds the host for the next generation Their mother places them as eggs on or in the body of a host which provides food for their growth Normal parasites use Vector vectors as their main means of getting to other hosts In Hymenoptera there are many variations and the distinction between the parasitic and the traditional hymenoptera can run very thin In Britain there are about species of Hymenoptera and just one of the parasitoid superfamilies Ichneumonoidea contains nearly half of them Most workers now recognise only two families in Ichneumonoidea These are Ichneumon idae with over two thousand British species and Braconidae with nearly representatives in Britain They are respectively the largest and the second largest families of British insects Only a beetle family the Staphylinidae is near the thousand mark Ichneumonoids also include the largest parasitoids Hymenopteran parasitoids often have unique life cycle s In one family the Trigonalidae the female wasps deposit eggs into small pockets they cut into the edge of leaves with their ovipositor A caterpillar chewing these leaves may swallow some of the eggs When they get into the caterpillar s gut they hatch and burrow through the gut wall and into the body cavity Later they search the caterpillar s body cavity for other parasitoid larvae and it is these they attack and feed on Some trigonalids once in a caterpillar or sawfly larva need their host to fall prey to a social wasp The wasp carries the caterpillar back to its nest and there it is butchered and fed to the wasp s young The young serve as host for the trigonalid the eggs of which are in the butchered caterpillar
