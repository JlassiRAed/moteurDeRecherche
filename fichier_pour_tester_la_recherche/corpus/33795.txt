 Whaling is the practice of hunting whale s This is done to get meat and oil called blubber Hunters of whales are called whaler s Whaling has been done at least since BC Many communities on the coast have done whaling for food for a long time They have also killed stranded whales Industrialisation started in the th century and also affected whaling Special ships were built for whaling and whales were hunted until they were almost extinction extinct As technology improved and demand for the seemingly vast resources remained high far more whales were killed than were born In the late s more than whales were killed each year By the middle of the th century there were not enough whales and they were at risk of becoming Extinction extinct In the International Whaling Commission introduced a Moratorium moratorium on commercial whaling so that whales might recover This moratorium was successful and whale stocks recovered There is a debate about whaling in general Countries which are in favor of whaling want to do away with the moratorium so they can again hunt whales as they did before Countries and environmental groups say that whaling is immoral and should be banned and that stocks have not yet recovered sufficiently
