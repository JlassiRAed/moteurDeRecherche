The genetic code is the set of rules by which information Code encoded within genetic material molecules to carry amino acids and to read the mRNA The molecules read the mRNA three nucleotide s at a time These nucleotide triplets are called codons A codon specifies which amino acid will be added next during protein synthesis There are some exceptions but usually a three nucleotide codon represents a single amino acid The genetic code among all organism s is very similar It can be expressed in a simple table with entries The genetic code decides the protein sequence for a given coding region Other regions in the genome can influence gene expression when and where these proteins are produced
