A real time operating system is a Computer multitasking multitasking operating system design ed for real time computing real time applications Such applications include embedded system s industrial robot s scientific research equipment and others An RTOS simplifies the creation of a real time computing real time applications but does not guarantee the final result will be real time this requires good Computer program development of the software Real time operating systems use specialized Scheduling scheduling algorithm s in order to provide the real time computing real time Computer program applications An RTOS can respond more quickly and or Predictability predictably to an Event driven programming event than other operating system s The main feature s of an RTOS are minimal interrupt latency and a minimal thread switching latency The basic two design s for RTOS are
