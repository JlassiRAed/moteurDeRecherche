A DNA construct is an artificial ly constructed segment of nucleic acid which is going to be transplanted into a target Biological tissue tissue or Cell cell It often contains a DNA insert which contains the gene sequence encoding a protein of interest The DNA insert has been subcloned into a molecular biology vector A DNA construct may express wildtype protein or prevent the expression of certain genes by expressing competitors or inhibitors It may express mutant proteins such as deletion mutations or missense mutation s A DNA construct is often used in molecular biology to analyze macromolecule s such as proteins or RNA in more detail
