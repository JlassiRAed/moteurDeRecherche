The carbon cycle is the way carbon is stored and replaced on Earth Some of the main events take hundreds of millions of years others happen annually The main ways that carbon gets into the carbon cycle are volcanoes and the burning of fossil fuel s like coal and natural gas gas Through most of history volcanoes were the biggest source of carbon to the carbon cycle but in the last hundred years people burning fossil fuels have added much more CO have been added to the air by people The main way carbon gets taken out of the atmosphere is by photosynthesis by living organisms Some of this gets released as they die and decompose but a proportion gets buried in sediment This is shown in the diagram Sediment turns to Rock rock and it is the carbonate rocks like limestone which contain the now solid CO Some of the carbon from plants also becomes part of the soil where it can stay for a long time before decomposing Another process takes CO in the form of dilute carbonic acid This reacts with rock helping to dissolve and destroy it This also ends up as sediment Weathering is a large consumer of the atmospheric carbon dioxide essential for dissolving rocks Some CO than they are releasing every year However this is making the oceans more acidic The store of carbon in sedimentary rock is far greater than the CO This completes the cycle
