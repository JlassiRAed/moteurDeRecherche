 Muon catalyzed fusion than an electron drags the heavier triton and the deuteron to it creating something called a muonic heavy hydrogen ion This means that the particle is a hydrogen atom with more proton s then electrons that contains a muon and that contains extra neutrons which make it heavier This reaction can be done at room temperature or below such as degrees Celsius To create these a stream of negative muons is sent onto blocks of protium deuterium and tritium The muon bumps out the electron in the hydrogen atom Because the electron is replaced any atoms are bound together This makes a molecular ion also called a special muonic molecule A muon is times more massive then an electron Because of the difference in mass the atom changes Because it is heavier the atoms in the molecular ion are pressed very tightly together and then the nuclei the centers of the atoms join together The following process is called nuclear fusion The nuclei join together and glue together But their weights do not just add up a part of their mass is released as energy This is the energy used Now the process continues because the muon is thrown out of the nuclei when they fuse so it can join other nuclei which continues the reaction Sometimes the muon is attached to something else thrown out from the nucleus and the muon is lost This stops the reaction The good thing about this is that muon catalyzed fusion uses little energy and produces much energy The only problem is that the reaction is not stable so it does not last a long time because the muons are lost This process is still a long way from being used for business de Kalte Fusion Myonen katalysierte Fusion
