A bipolar junction transistor is a type of transistor that relies on the contact of two types of semiconductor in order for it to work BJTs can be used as amplifier s switches or in oscillator s BJTs can be found either on their own or in large numbers as parts of integrated circuit s They are named bipolar transistors because their operation involves both electron s and electron hole holes The current gained is measured in h Forward Current Gain Typical amount can be between
