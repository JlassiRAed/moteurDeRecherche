A selectable marker is a reporter gene introduced into a cell cell along with a DNA insert gene insert What this means is the experimenter can tell the right gene is in the cell because the marker can be seen or detected Most often this is used for bacterium bacteria or for cells in cell culture culture Selectable markers show the success of a transfection or other procedure meant to introduce foreign DNA into a cell It is a technique in gene targeting and gene knockout Selectable markers are often antibiotic resistance genes bacteria that have been subjected to a procedure to introduce foreign DNA are grown on a medium containing an antibiotic The antibiotic knocks out cells which do not have the resistant marker Those bacterial colony colonies that can grow have successfully taken up and gene expression expressed the introduced genetic material An alternative to a selectable marker is a screenable marker which allows the researcher to distinguish between wanted and unwanted cells Examples of selectable markers include Beta lactamase which confers ampicillin resistance to bacterial hosts Neo gene from Tn which confers antibiotic resistance to kanamycin in bacteria and to geneticin in eukaryote cells Mutant FabI gene from E coli genome which confers triclosan resistance to the host
