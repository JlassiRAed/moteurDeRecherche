To be hanged drawn and quartered was a punishment in England used for men found guilty of treason high treason The full punishment was made up of the following the victim was Dragged usually by a horse on a wooden frame to the place where he was to be publicly death penalty put to death This is one possible meaning of drawn hanging Hanged by the neck for a short time or until almost dead Removed from hanging and placed on a table Still alive the victim was cut open in the abdomen and his intestines and sex organ sex organs removed The removed organs were burned in a flame prepared close to the prisoner The victim s decapitation head was cut off and the rest of the body hacked into four parts or quarters Typically the five body parts was removed from English criminal law in drawing and quartering in There is debate among modern historians about whether drawing referred to the dragging to the place of execution or the disembowelling but since two different words are used in the official documents detailing the trial of William Wallace there is no doubt that the subjects of the punishment were disembowelled Judges delivering sentence at the Old Bailey also seemed to have had some confusion over the term drawn and some sentences are summarized as Drawn Hanged and Quartered Nevertheless the sentence was often recorded quite explicitly For example the record of the trial of Thomas Wallcot John Rouse William Hone and William Blake for offences against the king on July concludes as follows The Oxford English Dictionary notes both meanings of drawn To draw out the viscera or the like to the place of execution It states that In many cases of executions it is uncertain which of these senses of drawn is meant The presumption is that where drawn is mentioned after hanged the sense is the second meaning The condemned man would usually be sentenced to the short drop method of hanging so that the neck would not break The man was usually dragged alive to the quartering table although in some cases men were brought to the table dead or unconscious A splash of water was usually employed to wake the man if unconscious then he was laid down on the table A large cut was made in the gut after removing the genitalia and the intestines would be spooled out on a device that resembled a dough roller Each piece of organ would be burned before the sufferer s eyes and when he was completely disembowelled his head would be cut off The body would then be cut into four pieces and the king would decide where they were to be displayed Usually the head was sent to the Tower of London and as in the case of William Wallace the other four pieces were sent to different parts of the country The head was generally par boiled in brine to preserve the appearance of the head in display while the quarters were more often prepared in pitch for longer lasting deterrent displays
