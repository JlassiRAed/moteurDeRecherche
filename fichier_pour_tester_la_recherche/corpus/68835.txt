 Remipedia is a Class class of blind crustacean s found in coastal aquifer s So long as the water is salty these little animals can be found They are found in almost every ocean basin so far explored including in Australia the Caribbean Sea the Atlantic Ocean The first described remipede was a fossil called Tesnusocaris goldichi Since at least living species have been identified They live in the neo tropical zone Remipedes are The swimming appendage s are on the sides of each segment and the animals swim on their backs They are generally slow moving They have fangs connected to secretory gland s it is still unknown whether these glands secrete digestive juices or poisonous Venom venom or whether remipedes feed primarily on detritus or on living organisms They have a primitive body plan in crustacean terms and may be a basal ancestral crustacean group At least one species Godzilliognomus frondosus has an organised brain with a particularly large olfactory area Species which live in dark environments need to detect scents in the water The size and complexity of the brain suggested that Remipedia might be the sister taxon to Malacostraca regarded as the most advanced of the crustaceans
