 Asynchronous Transfer Mode is a set of protocol s used for computer network s It is mostly used for Wide Area Network s It splits the data and encodes it into packets of a fixed size Each packet can be routed differently along virtual paths set up in the network ATM has been very successful in WANs as well as in Local Area Network s Today many ADSL implementations use ATM technology Standards like Ethernet usually are quite simple When there is little traffic on the network they work well However when there is a lot of traffic it is difficult to predict how an Ethernet network will behave For this reason Ethernet cannot give any service guarantees It is not possible to say that an Ethernet packet will take a maximum delay but after that time it is guaranteed to arrive ATM is more complex but this complexity allows to give guarantees as to data rate maximum delay and jitter These are usually called Quality of Service
