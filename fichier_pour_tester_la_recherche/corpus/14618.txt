In chemistry a solution is a homogeneous mixture of two or more substance s The substances that are solvation dissolved are called solutes The substance the solutes are dissolved in is called the solvent An example from everyday experience is a solid like salt or sugar Gas es can dissolve in liquids An example is carbon dioxide or oxygen in water Liquids may dissolve in other liquids and gases in other gases The amount of solute added to the solvent determines the concentration of the solution The solution with the large amount of solute is called a concentrated solution the solution with less solute is called a dilute solution Examples of solid solutions are alloy s and some mineral s For example brass is an alloy of copper and zinc
