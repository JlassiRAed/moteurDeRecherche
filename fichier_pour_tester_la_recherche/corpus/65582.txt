 Radiocarbon dating also known as the C dating method is a way of telling how old something is It is a type of radiometric dating The method uses the radioactivity radioactive isotope carbon Most organic matter contains carbon Carbon has different isotope s which are usually not radioactive C is the radioactive one its Half life Plants take up atmospheric carbon dioxide by photosynthesis and are eaten by animals so every living thing is constantly exchanging carbon with its environment as long as it lives Once it dies however this exchange stops In Hessel de Vries showed that the concentration of carbon in the atmosphere varies with time and wikt locality locality The relatively short lived C taken into organic matter is also slightly variable That leads to errors in the chronology However under about years the results can be compared with dendrochronology based on tree rings For the most accurate work variations are compensated by means of calibration curves The method was developed by Willard Libby and his colleagues at the University of Chicago in In he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for this work He first demonstrated the accuracy of radiocarbon dating by accurately estimating the age of wood from an ancient Egypt ian royal barge of which the age was known from historical documents
