 Ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase better known as RuBisCO is an enzyme that catalyze s the first major step of carbon fixation in the Calvin cycle Carbon fixation is a process by which the atom s of atmospheric carbon dioxide are made available to organism s in the form of fuel energy rich molecule s such as glucose RuBisCO splits C molecules into two equal parts RuBisCO is very important in biology and ecology because it catalyzes the primary chemical reaction by which Inorganic chemistry inorganic carbon permanently enters the biosphere RuBisCO is also the most abundant protein in leaf leaves and the most abundant protein on Earth Given its important role in the biosphere there are currently efforts to Genetic engineering genetically engineer crop plants to contain more efficient RuBisCO Ellis R John Biochemistry tackling unintelligent design Nature doi a
