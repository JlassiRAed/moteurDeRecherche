In baseball statistics an error is the act in the judgment of the official scorer of a fielder misplaying a ball in a manner that allows a batting batter or baserunner to reach one or more additional bases when such an advance would have been prevented given ordinary effort by the fielder An error does not count as a hit and an error However if a batter is judged to have reached base solely because of a fielder s mistake it is scored as a hit on error and treated the same as if a batter was put out which would lower his batting average Similarly a batter does not receive credit for an RBI when runs score on an error unless the scorer rules that a run would have scored even if the fielder had not made a mistake For example if a batter hits a ball to the outfield for what should be a sacrifice fly and the outfielder drops the ball for an error the batter will still receive credit for the sacrifice fly and the run batted in If a play should have resulted in a fielder s choice with a runner being put out and the batter reaching base safely but the runner is safe due to an error the play will be scored as a fielder s choice with no hit being awarded to the batter and an error charged against the fielder Passed ball s and wild pitch es are separate statistical categories and are not scored as errors
