 Sacrifice It was held on May at the Impact Zone in Orlando Florida Orlando Florida It was the eighth TNA Sacrifice Sacrifice event that TNA held and was also the fifth event in TNA s pay per view schedule There were eight matches on the card The main event saw Bobby Roode defeat Rob Van Dam in a Ladder match to retain the TNA World Heavyweight Championship Sacrifice gained mixed to positive reviews Dave Meltzer of the Wrestling Observer Newsletter thought of the show as an easy thumbs up show he would also said I will admit to be bored through some of the early parts of it That wasn t necessarily due to the show not being good but mainly because I m rather cold on the product at the moment Things really picked up for the last three matches Austin Aries had his breakout match in TNA tonight If and that s a big IF TNA follows up on it properly they may have something here with Austin Aries
