A lone pair is a group of two electron s that are not used in any chemical bond bond s between atom s They are always in the last shell of an atom the valence electron valence shell Together with the electrons used in bonding they make up the total number of valence electrons They are usually high in energy A lone pair can be used to form new bonds between molecule s Nucleophile s always have a lone pair that is used to attack an electrophile Lone pairs are also important for the shape of a molecule They take more space around an atom than a bonding electron Lone pairs on a same atom want to be as far away from each other as possible
