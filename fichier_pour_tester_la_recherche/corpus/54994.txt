 Carburization is the process by which carbon is introduced into a metal One does it to make the surface harder and more Wear Abrasive wear abrasion resistant But because too great a concentration of carbon makes metal brittle and unworkable metals are also often decarburization decarburized Depending on the amount of time and temperature the affected area can vary in carbon content In earlier times one used a direct application of charcoal packed onto the metal for carburization but modern techniques use carbon bearing gases or plasmas Carburization is mainly used to harden the surface of low alloy steel
