A nuclear power plant is a type of power station that generates electricity using heat from nuclear reaction s These reactions take place within a Nuclear reactor reactor The plant also has machines which remove heat from the reactor to operate a steam turbine and generator to make electricity Electricity made by nuclear power plants is called nuclear power Nuclear power plants are usually near water to remove the heat the reactor makes Some nuclear power plants use cooling towers to do this Nuclear power plants use uranium as fuel When the reactor is on uranium atom s inside the reactor split into two smaller atoms When uranium atoms split they give off a large amount of heat This splitting of atoms is called Nuclear fission fission The most popular atoms to fission are uranium and plutonium Those atoms are slightly radioactive The atoms produced when fuel atoms break apart are strongly radioactive Today fission only happens in nuclear reactors In nuclear reactors fission only happens when the reactors parts are arranged properly Nuclear power plants turn their reactors off when replacing old nuclear fuel with new fuel There are about four hundred nuclear power plants in the world with many in the United States France and Japan Some famous accidents at nuclear power plants were the Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan Chernobyl disaster in Ukraine and the Three Mile Island accident in the United States There has been a recent debate about installing a nuclear power plant within Australia many people do not want this and many do want it its been a highly controversial debate in the country
