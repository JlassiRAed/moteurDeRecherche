An elastic modulus or modulus of elasticity is the mathematical description of an object or substance s tendency to be deformed elastically force is applied to it The elastic modulus of an object is defined as the slope of its stress strain curve in the elastic deformation region where is the ratio of the change caused by the stress to the original state of the object If one specifies how stress and strain are to be measured that allows for many types of elastic moduli to be defined
