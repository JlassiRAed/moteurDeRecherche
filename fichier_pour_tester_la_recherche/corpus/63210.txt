The Link reaction also known as pyruvate decarboxylation or the Swanson Conversion forms an important link between the metabolic pathways of glycolysis and the citric acid or Krebs cycle In eukaryote s the reaction takes place only inside the mitochondria l matrix in prokaryote s similar reactions take place in the cytoplasm and at the plasma membrane To summarise Pyruvate is decarboxylated CO is removed It is added to Coenzyme A CoA to form Acetyl CoA Acetyl CoA Acetyl CoA is then ready for use in the Krebs Cycle The Link reaction is important as acetyl CoA is needed for the Krebs cycle to happen
