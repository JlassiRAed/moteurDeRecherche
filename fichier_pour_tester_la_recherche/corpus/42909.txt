 Radio frequency identification is a technology to record the presence of an object using radio signals It is used for inventory control or timing sporting events RFID is not a replacement for the barcode barcoding but a complement for distant reading of codes The technology is used for automatically identifying a person a package or an item To do this it relies on RFID tags These are small transponders that will transmit identity information over a short distance when asked The other piece to make use of RFID tags is an RFID tag reader An RFID tag is an object that can be applied to or incorporated into a product animal or person for the purpose of identification and tracking using radio wave s Some tags can be read from several meters away and beyond the line of sight of the reader Most tags carry a plain text inscription and a barcode as complements for direct reading and for cases of any failure of radio frequency electronics Most RFID tags contain at least two parts One is an integrated circuit for storing and processing information modulation modulating and de modulating a radio frequency signal and other specialized functions The second is an antenna for receiving and transmitting the signal There are generally two types of RFID tags active RFID tags which contain a battery and passive RFID tags which have no battery
