 General relativity is a theory of Space General relativity Mathematical Physics index School of Mathematics and Statistics University of St Andrews Scotland May Retrieved The central idea of general relativity is that space and time are two aspects of spacetime Spacetime is curved when there is gravity matter energy and momentum The links between these forces are shown in the Einstein field equations A central idea in general relativity is the principle of equivalence An example is that two people one in an elevator sitting on the surface of the earth and the other in an elevator in outer space accelerating at m sThe Sun can be seen as this kind of valley in spacetime and one of the other objects in the valley is the Earth The Earth does not roll directly towards the Sun because it is velocity moving too fast The force pulling the Earth towards the sun is about the same as a second force This second force is called the centrifugal force The centrifugal force exists because the Earth moves sideways This sideways motion makes the distance between the Earth and Sun increase Since the Earth is being pulled towards the sun and moving away at the same time it stays at about the same distance This is also how the Moon orbits the earth In this second case Earth is the ball and the Moon is the object General relativity has predicted many things which were later seen These include Redshift from gravity When light moves away from an object with gravity it is stretched into longer wavelengths This was confirmed by the Pound Rebka experiment
