An address bus is a computer bus computer architecture architecture It is used to transfer data between devices The devices are identified by the hardware address of the physical memory The address is stored in the form of binary numbers to enable the data bus to access memory storage  A collection of wires connecting the  CPU  with main computer memory memory  that is used to identify particular locations determines how many unique memory locations can be addressed Modern  personal computer s and  Apple Macintosh Macintoshes  have as many as address lines That lets them which enables them theoretically to access   gigabyte s of main memory However the actual amount of memory that can be accessed is usually much less than this theoretical limit due to chipset and motherboard limitations An address bus is part of the system bus architecture which was developed to decrease costs and enhance modular integration However most modern computers use a variety of individual buses for specific tasks  An individual computer contains a system bus which connects the major components of a computer system and has three main elements of which the address bus is one along with the data bus and control bus An address bus is measured by the amount of memory a system can retrieve A system with a bit address bus can address gigabytes of memory space Newer computers using a bit address bus with a supporting operating system can address exbibytes of memory locations which is virtually unlimited
