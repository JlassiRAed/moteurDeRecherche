An internal combustion engine is an engine in which combustion or the fire burning of fuel occurs on the inside It is a machine that makes large pressure increases inside a sealed box The pressure increase pushes a rod which is attached to a wheel The rod pushes the wheel and makes it spin around The spinning wheel is attached to other wheels such as four car wheels with a belt or a chain The engine is very strong and can make all the wheels move Engines need oil to make them slippery or the moving parts would grind together and stick Parts of a car engine are measured to of a millimeter and some engine parts fit together very tightly Internal differs from external combustion where the fire is outside the engine such as a steam engine Most road vehicles use the internal combustion engine today and most of those use the four stroke engine Rocket engine Rocket and jet engine s are combustion engines but they do not turn wheels The fire in a rocket combustion engine is so strong that it blows a mighty wind out the back which pushes the rocket forward Another type of internal combustion engine is the Wankel engine
