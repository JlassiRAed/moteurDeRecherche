There are areas on the periodic table where elements have similar properties For example all of the first column elements bases and react with the halogen s to make colorless ionic bond ionic compounds The second column elements are a little heavier a little harder react with water a little less rapidly made hydroxide s that are strong bases and react with the halogens to make colorless ionic compounds The other categories are transition metal s pnictogen s chalcogen s halogen s and noble gas es There are also inner transition metal s that are divided into lanthanide s and actinide s
