One of the most pressing tasks for the new government was to draft a new constitution When martial law was finally lifted the Assembly was summoned in April on the basis of the Pakistani general election I Pakistan shall be a Federal Republic with a Parliamentary system of government The prime minister shall be the head of government elected from the majority party II The special position of Islam as the state religion shall be emphasized and both the prime minister and president are required to be Muslims III Pakistan shall be declared an Islamic Republic by default IV A bill to amend the constitution shall need a two thirds majority in the lower house and a majority in the upper house V All fundamental human rights shall be guaranteed but the stipulation was added that it was subject to resonable restrictions imposed by law VI The Supreme Court of Pakistan Supreme Court and High Courts shall be given the power to enforce fundamental rights VII The president shall act in accordance with the binding advice of the prime minister and all orders of president shall be counter signed by the prime minister VIII The senate or upper house shall be elected mostly from the provincial governments and so for the first time the interests of the provinces shall be safeguarded at the centre The Senate shall not be dissolved even in emergencies IX In case of emergencies the federal government can pass legislation on anything and can even suspend fundamental freedoms X Urdu shall be the official language of the country with Pakistani English to be retained for the next years Xl The teaching of holy Quran and Islamiat should be compulsory XlI Pakistan shall be a federal Islamic state so residuary powers shall rest with provinces not the central government The Constitution therefore marked a return to a parliamentary form of democracy after the presidential experiment introduced under the constitution There were also concessions made to the provinces to alleviate fears that the central government would overule them on every issue This was important as the one unit scheme had only recently been abolished and because of the provincial governments in the new State of Pakistan were non PPP The Constitution however had another advantage over its two predecessors it had been agreed and voted on by a democratically elected Assembly This gave it greater authority and even though it was suspended under the next martial law regime Since independence Pakistan has devised and changed three written constitutions and the fourth one was drawn up and it was restored in and remains in place to date
