In organic chemistry torquoselectivity describes electrocyclic reaction s that produce one isomer more than the other An official definition is the preference for inward or outward rotation of substituent s in Conrotatory and disrotatory conrotatory or Conrotatory and disrotatory disrotatory electrocyclic reaction s cite title Torquoselectivity in the Electrocyclic Conversion of Benzocyclobutenes to o Xylylenes author Jefford C W Bernardinelli G Wang Y Spellmeyer D C Buda A Houk K N journal J Am Chem Soc year volume page doi jaa In other words a chemical reaction is torquoselective if the groups of atoms that hang from a ring of atoms are more likely to have rotated in a particular direction during the reaction The concept was originally developed by Kendall N Houk When a chemical reaction ring closing reaction closes a ring its torquoselectivity is the same as enantioselectivity A single enantiomer of a cyclization product is formed from the selective ring closure of the starting material In a typical electrocyclic ring closing selection for either Conrotatory and disrotatory conrotatory or Conrotatory and disrotatory disrotatory reactions modes still produces two enantiomers Torquoselectivity is a discrimination between these possible enantiomer s that requires asymmetric induction Torquoselectivity also happens in selective electrocyclic reactions that break open rings The different directions of rotation produce wikt distinct distinct structural isomers In these cases steric strain is often the driving force for the selectivity Studies have shown that the selectivity can also be changed by the presence of electron donating group electron donating and electron withdrawing group s cite title Stereoselective Substituent Effects on ConrotatoryElectrocyclic Reactions of Cyclobutenes author Kirmse W Rondan N G Houk K N journal J Am Chem Soc year volume page doi jaa Torquoselectivity can also apply to other mechanisms including chirality and axial to tetrahedral chirality transfer An example of axial to tetrahedral chirality transfer is shown below for the torquoselective Nazarov cyclization reaction of a chiral allenyl vinyl ketone
