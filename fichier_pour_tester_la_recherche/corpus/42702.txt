A logic gate is an electronic component that can be used to conduct electricity based on a rule The outputs of the gate is the result of applying this rule to one or more sources These sources may be two wires or the output of other logic gates Logic gates are digital components They normally work at only two levels of voltage a positive level and a zero level Commonly they work based on two states On and Off In the On state voltage is present In the Off state the voltage is at zero The On state usually uses a voltage in the range of to volt s This range can be lower for some uses Logic gates compare the state at their inputs to decide what the state at their output should be A logic gate is on or active when its rules are correctly met At this time electricity is flowing through the gate and the voltage at its output is at the level of its On state Logic gates are electronics electronic versions of Boolean algebra Boolean logic Truth tables will tell you what the output will be depending on the inputs
