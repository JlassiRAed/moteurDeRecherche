A hyperbola is a type of conic section Like the other three types of conic sections parabola s ellipse s and circle s it is a curve formed by the intersection of a cone and a plane axis of the cone and the plane is less than the angle between a line on the side of the cone and the plane Hyperbolas can be found in many places in nature For example an object in open orbit around another object where it never returns can move in the shape of a hyperbola On a sundial the path followed by the tip of the shadow over time is a hyperbola One of the most well known hyperbolas is the graph of the equation
