 Nyasasaurus is an extinct genus of Archosaur reptile from the Middle Triassic Manda Beds of Tanzania It may be the earliest known dinosaur The discovery was a handful of bones from two individuals so its anatomy is only partly known The bones were collected in the early s but have only recently been analysed Researchers said Nyasasaurus possesses a unique combination of dinosaur character states and an elevated growth rate similar to that of definitive early dinosaurs It demonstrates that the initial dinosaur radiation occurred over a longer timescale than previously thought The find was six vertebra e and a humerus from one specimen and five vertebrae from another The humerus has a muscle attachment which is characteristic of dinosaurs Other features are consistent with its being a basal dinosaur Previously the oldest record of dinosaurs was from Argentina and dated back to the Upper Triassic Carnian stage about million years ago Nyasasaurus comes from a deposit that dates back to the Middle Triassic Anisian stage meaning that it predates other early dinosaurs by about million years Nesbitt S J et al The oldest dinosaur A Middle Triassic dinosauriform from Tanzania Biological Letters
