 Etching is made by drawing lines through a protective coating on a copper or zinc plate The plate is then placed into acid The acid cuts into the unprotected parts of the surface to create a design in the metal The printing is done by rolling an ink pad across the surface The ink sinks into the intaglio surface and rolls off the wax ed surface off the plate The metal plate is then pressed onto paper
