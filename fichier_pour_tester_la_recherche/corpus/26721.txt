 Numerical integration is the term used for a number of methods to find an approximation for an integral Numerical integration has also been called quadrature Very often it is not possible to solve integration Analysis analytically for example when the data consists of a number of distinct measurement s or when the antiderivative is not known and it is difficult impractical or impossible to find it In such cases the integral can be written as a function interval in question plus a function giving the error One way to find a numerical integral is using interpolation Very often these interpolating functions are polynomial s math stub
