 Complexity theory is a type of Computer science It looks at how hard a problem is to do for a computer and how good particular solutions to that problem are Different algorithms that solve a problem may be better or worse in multiple ways An algorithm may be faster than some other algorithm but it may need more resource s like memory Part of complexity theory is understanding how algorithms perform in their worst case scenario An algorithm s worst case scenario is a problem that will take a long time or lots of resources to solve If people know how good an algorithm is in its worst case they can guarantee that the algorithm will be at least that good in every case People are also interested in how a certain algorithm does on average many algorithms are very inefficient in their worst case but are okay on most cases Knowing how good an algorithm is on average lets people know what to generally expect when using that algorithm
