 Courtship in animals is the behaviour by which different species select their partners for Sexual reproduction reproduction Usually the male starts the courtship and the female chooses to either mate or reject the male based on his performance Many animals have mate selection courtship rituals Animal courtship may involve complicated dances or touching vocalizations or displays of beauty or fighting prowess One animal whose courtship rituals are well studied is the bowerbird whose male builds a bower of collected objects Another is the Great Crested Grebe whose courtship dances were first described by Julian Huxley In cases like the Great Crested Grebe the pairs form life partnerships In that case there are also pair bonding dances throughout the mating season and through the whole period of raising the young If pairs get separated there are exceptionally vigorous dances when they come together There are a number of dance routines which occur in the different circumstances of life All this behaviour is heritability inherited though the individual bird remembers the place and the partner permanently It might be thought that courtship only occurs in the kind of animals which have fairly complex brain s such as mammals and birds This is not the case Male Drosophila flies have to do a mating dance in front of the female before she will allow them to mate If the dance is not correct for that species she refuses the male It was discovered over fifty years ago that if the male carries a mutation which disrupts the dance he cannot achieve mating the females reject him This behaviour is clearly advantageous to the female whose genes have a better chance of contributing to the next generation if her partner is biologically fitness fit
