In Simple English Wikipedia many people work together to make an encyclopedia Sometimes users do not agree on what is written in an article or on a talk page Rather than commenting on what is wrong with the article or talk page they make a bad comment about the user the person who wrote the comment This is called a personal attack and will not be tolerated Personal attacks help no one They will not help people make a point about an issue There are some users who wanted to help making this Wikipedia better but who no longer want to because the personal attack scared them away People who make bad comments about other people must show these comments are true If they can not or do not want to do this making bad comments about another user is considered to be a personal attack People who make personal attacks may be blocked so they can no longer change this Wikipedia People who make personal attacks over and over again may be blocked indefinitely
