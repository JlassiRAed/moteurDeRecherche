An inflow is a river that leads to a lake or some other body of water The inflow gives the lake a supply of water If lakes have no way of getting water added to them they will eventually dry up through evaporation Some lakes are big enough that they can stay full through rain instead of inflows An example of such a lake is the Great Salt Lake in Utah
