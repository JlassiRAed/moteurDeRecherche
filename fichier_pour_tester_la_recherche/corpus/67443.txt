 For a full account of the biological family see Hominidae For the novel by Klaus Ebner see Hominid A hominid is any member of the biological family Hominidae These are the great apes living and extinct At present there are human s chimpanzee s gorilla s and orangutan s The word hominid has been used in various ways The classification of the great apes Ape History of hominoid taxonomy has been revised several times in the last few decades These revisions led to different uses of the word hominid The original meaning of the taxon Hominidae meant only humans and their closest relatives Now this group is called the Hominina The primatology primatological term hominid is easily confused with a number of very similar words The dispute is really about whether humans and Australopithecine s are sufficiently different from chimpanzees to rank as a separate family In Morphology Later hunting and social needs led to larger brains brain s and the making and use of tools These differences between human beings and the other great apes are certainly important However a genetically based taxonomy taxonomic classification shows the genetic differences are not enough to divide us into separate families Genetics rather than morphology is more widely accepted as the critical standard Many scientists including anthropologist s use the term hominid to mean humans and their direct and near direct bipedal ancestors
