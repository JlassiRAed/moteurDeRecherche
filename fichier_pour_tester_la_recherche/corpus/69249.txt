 A landslide includes a wide range of ground movement such as Rock rock falls deep failure of slopes and shallow debris flows The biggest reason for a landslide is always that there is a slope and material goes down the slope because of gravity But other things also contribute to landslides An underlying reason is the nature of the material For example a thixotropic material such as mud or sand and water can change from a gel to a Sol sol by adding water or pressure or shaking It goes from being stable one minute to fluid the next minute The greatest disasters like lahar s or mudslide s happen suddenly It is possible for much of a volcano to just slide down suddenly as with Toba Krakatoa and Mount St Helens
