A deadlock is a situation wherein two or more competing actions are waiting for the other to finish As a consequence neither ever does It is often seen in a paradox like the chicken or the egg cquote When two trains approach each other at a crossing both shall come to a full stop and neither shall start up again until the other has gone In computer science deadlock refers to a specific condition when two or more processes are each waiting for each other to release a resource It can also be that more than two processes are waiting for a number of resources Deadlock is a common problem in multiprocessing where many processes share a specific type of mutually exclusive resource known as a lock deadlocks This situation may be likened to two people who are drawing diagrams with only one pencil and one ruler between them If one person takes the pencil and the other takes the ruler a deadlock occurs when the person with the pencil needs the ruler and the person with the ruler needs the pencil to finish his work with the ruler Both requests can t be satisfied so a deadlock occurs The telecommunications description of deadlock is a little stronger deadlock occurs when none of the processes meet the condition to move to another state and all the communication channels are empty The second condition is often left out on other systems but is important in the telecommunication context
