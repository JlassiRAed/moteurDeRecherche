 Mie scattering is the way that light Compton scattering scatter s when it hits an object It is named after the Germany German physicist Gustav Mie This theory is good for all wavelength s of light and all object sizes If the object is much smaller than the wavelength of light Rayleigh scattering theory is also quite good When the object is big the light can hit many places on the object A quite good formula for the scattering is category physics
