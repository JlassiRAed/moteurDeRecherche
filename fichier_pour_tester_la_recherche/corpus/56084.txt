 Warp drive is Hypothesis hypothetical technology created in science fiction It is a way of moving objects faster than the speed of light There are many examples of how this idea is used A well known one is found in the Star Trek Fictional universe universe where faster than light travel is needed to tell the story Current technology does not allow anything or anyone to go at or faster than the speed of light Unless the current theory theories are proven wrong this will always be true However warp technology as a fictional idea has been an interesting way of shaping the story line to let spacecraft spaceships move at speeds greater than mile s per second Warp technology as the name implies warps space in effect bringing a destination closer by bending space rather than the traditional thruster means of propelling a space craft at highspeeds Warp technology allows ships move at warp speed In the Star Trek universe for example the measurement of the speed that the spaceship is moving is called the warp factor However thrusters and impulse power propel spaceships at sub light speed Warp factor is equal to the speed of light The speed ranges up to warp factor In some circumstances Star Trek spaceships can go faster than warp although rare tv stub
