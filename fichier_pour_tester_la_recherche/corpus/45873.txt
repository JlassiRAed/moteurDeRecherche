 Fitness in biology is the relative ability of an organism to survive and pass on its gene s to the next generation It is a central idea in evolution evolutionary theory Fitness is usually equal to the proportion of the individual s gene s in all the genes of the next generation Like all terms in evolutionary biology fitness is defined in terms of an interbreeding Population genetics population which might or might not be a whole species If differences in individual genotypes affect fitness then the frequencies of the genotypes will change over generations the genotypes with higher fitness become more common This is the process called natural selection An individual s fitness is caused by its phenotype and passed on by its genotype The fitnesses of different individuals with the same genotype are not necessarily equal It depends on the environment in which the individuals live and on accidental event s However since the fitness of the genotype is an average d quantity it reflects the reproductive outcomes of all individuals with that genotype
