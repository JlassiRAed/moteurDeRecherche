A simple machine is a device that can change the direction or the Magnitude force or the point where it is applied This is done so that the force can be used to do work All mechanics mechanical machine s are made by combining simple machines There are six basic simple machines as defined by Renaissance scientists The lever can move the point at which a force is applied and may also change the magnitude and direction of the force The wheel change the direction in which the force is applied The pulley changes the point where a force is applied and may also change its magnitude and direction The inclined plane The wedge wedge The screw that converts rotational motion to linear motion and a rotational force to a linear force The use of simple machines can be traced back to homo habilis but certain animal s other than man also use them A compound machine is made up of two or more simple machines
