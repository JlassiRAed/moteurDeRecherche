 Denying the correlative is a mistake in logic where a person tries to create a third possibility where there are only two It is based on the concept of correlative conjunctions pairs of statements where one statement must be true and the other must be false For example Ginger is a cat Ginger is not a cat If a person claims that Ginger is something else than a cat or not a cat then he is making a logically impossible claim and denying the correlative It is the opposite of the false dilemma which tries to reduce options to only two Another is if a person were asked if he killed someone and said I fought with him That does not answer the question
