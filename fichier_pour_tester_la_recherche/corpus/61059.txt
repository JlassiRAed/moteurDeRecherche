A chimaera or chimera is a single organism made of two kinds of genetically distinct cells The two types of cells may come from separate Fertilisation fertilised eggs or zygote s Chimeras that originate from distinct Fertilisation fertilised eggs fused together are called dispermic chimeras When on the other hand the genetically distinct cell types originate from the same zygote the organism is called a Mosaic mosaic Dispermic chimaeras are formed from at least two fertilized eggs or early embryos fused together Each population of cells keeps its own phenotype and the resulting organism is a mixture of the two phenotypes Microchimerism is a form of chimerism in which a host harbors a small set of genetically distinct cells This often happens with blood transfusion or Transplant transplants but also during pregnancy due to the two way cell trafficking between the mother and the foetus Recently Epigenetics epigenetic chimeras have been discovered in mouse models
