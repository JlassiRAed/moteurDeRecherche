In string theory and theoretical physics string s are hypothetical objects that are believed to be the elementary particle s of the universe If they exist they would not be point like particles but rather dimensional strings of energy that vibrate in various dimension s The image to the right illustrates the various possible dimensions that a string could vibrate in The length of the strings would be determined by Planck length It is still not known whether these strings actually exist They are pretty much the main topic of string theory
