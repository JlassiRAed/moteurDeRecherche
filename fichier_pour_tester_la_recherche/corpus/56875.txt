An active galactic nucleus is a compact region at the centre of a galaxy This central region radiates huge luminosity over the electromagnetic spectrum The radiation from an AGN is thought to be caused by mass dragged in by the gravitation al pull of a supermassive black hole at the centre of the host galaxy This electromagnetic radiation is observed in the radio waves radio microwaves infrared visible spectrum optical ultra violet X ray and gamma ray wavebands A galaxy hosting an AGN is called an active galaxy AGN are the most luminous and persistent sources of electromagnetic radiation in the universe They can be used to discover distant objects All theories about cosmology the cosmos have to account for AGNs They are one of the basic facts about the universe So called relativistic jet s are extremely powerful jets of plasma which come from some AGNs notably radio galaxy radio galaxies and quasar s Biretta J Hubble detects faster than llight motion in Galaxy M University Office of Public Affairs Evidence for ultra energetic particles in jet from black hole
