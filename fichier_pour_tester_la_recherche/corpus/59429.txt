The Woodpecker Finch is a species of birds in the family Fringillidae They live in the Galapagos Islands and are named for their habit of eating Larva grubs that live in the woods But the woodpecker finch unlike woodpeckers does not have a long tongue or a bill that is suitable for getting hold of the grubs Instead it uses a cactus spine or twig that is the right shape to dig grubs out
