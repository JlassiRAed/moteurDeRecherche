In cryptography RC is a simple symmetric key algorithm symmetric key block cipher Designed by Ron Rivest Ronald Rivest in RC is a parameter ized algorithm with a variable Block size block size a variable key size and a variable number of rounds RC stands for Rivest Cipher or alternatively Ron s Code In order to provide varieties of security and efficiency levels RC has a variable block size The original suggested choice of parameters were a block size of bits a bit key and rounds cite webA key feature of RC is the use of data dependent Permutation box rotations one of the goals of RC was to study and evaluate operations of block cipher s as a cryptography cryptographic primitive RC also consists of a number of modular arithmetic modular additions and Xor eXclusive OR e and the golden ratio as sources of nothing up my sleeve number s The simplicity of the algorithm together with the novelty of the data dependent rotations has made RC an attractive subject to study by Cryptanalysis cryptanalysts
