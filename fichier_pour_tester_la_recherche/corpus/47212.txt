The Pauli exclusion principle refers to the fact that certain Elementary particles particles cannot be at the same place at the same time with the same energy Only fermion s are not A more precise way to describe the Pauli exclusion principle is to say that two of the same kind of fermions cannot have the same quantum number s This principle was discovered by physicist Wolfgang Pauli in It is a very important principle in physics because the particles that make up ordinary matter are fermions
