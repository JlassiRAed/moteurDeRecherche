In organic chemistry and biochemistry substituent is the name for a single atom or for a group of atoms that take the position of another atom in a molecule They replace this atom This chemical reaction reaction is called a substitution reaction The atom or group of atoms that gets replaced is called the leaving group The terms substituent side chain group branch or pendant group are used in the same way to describe branch es from a parent structure In polymers side chains extend from a backbone structure while they are wikt attach attached to the alpha carbon atoms of the amino acid backbone in protein s Organic chemistry has rules for naming compounds with substituent groups The substituent group is listed first with a suffix to describe how it is attached to the main carbon chain The suffix yl is used when naming organic compound s that contain a single bond replacing one hydrogen ylidene and ylidyne are used for double bond s and triple bond s respectively When naming hydrocarbon s that contain a substituent position numbers may be used These number will indicate which carbon atom the substituent is attached to One case where this information is needed is that of isomer s The phrases most substituted and least substituted are often used to describe molecules and predict their products For example
