 Frog s are amphibians of the order order Anura There is not much difference between frogs and toad s and they are not classified separately This is because the toad lifestyle with its dry rough skin is an adaptation to living in drier habitat s The toad form has evolved a number of times independently an example of convergent evolution Frogs can live on land and in fresh water They cannot survive in salt water Their development is by metamorphosis They usually hatch as tadpole s from Egg eggs which are laid by a female frog The eggs are called spawn frogspawn Tadpoles have tails and gill s When they grow up they lose their tail s and gills and grow four long legs Adult frogs can jump with their legs They have long tongue s that they use to catch insect bugs They make a sound called a croak Some species live in trees and some types of frog are Defence against predation protected by being poison ous Frogs live all over the world If an overseas species of frogs is introduced to another country the ecosystem might be affected Frog legs are sometimes eaten as food in France China and the Midwest of the United States The killing of frogs might have an effect on the ecosystem For example frogs eat mosquitoes If frogs are killed then there are fewer frogs to eat mosquitoes so more and more mosquitoes are born Therefore in these areas there are more diseases that mosquitoes carry because there are more mosquitoes However for this to apply frogs would have to be a major predator of mosquitoes This would only rarely be the case Frogs are members of the class class Lissamphibia the only class of amphibia which has survived to the present day
