In Christianity the Sign of the Dove was a prearranged sign by which John the Baptist would recognize the Messiah Gospel The four Gospels each record an account of the sign of the dove Matt And Jesus when he was baptized went up straightway out of the water and lo the heavens were opened unto him and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and lighting upon him The sign of the dove is also recorded in the Book of Mormon Ne abide upon him in the form of a dove Ne Holy Ghost descended upon him in the form of a dove Abr Fac Fig sign of the Holy Ghost in the form of a dove Joseph Smith taught The sign of the dove was instituted before the creation of the world a witness for the Holy Ghost and the devil cannot come in the sign of a dove The Holy Ghost is a personage and is in the form of a personage It does not confine itself to the form of the dove but in sign of the dove The Holy Ghost cannot be transformed into a dove but the sign of a dove was given to John who had baptized Jesus to signify the truth of the deed as the dove is an emblem or token of truth and innocence In Hebrew Jonah means dove
