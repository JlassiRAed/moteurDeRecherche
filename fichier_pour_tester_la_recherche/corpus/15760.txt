In electronics a multiplexer or mux is a device that selects one of many Analog signal analog or Digital signal digital input signals and outputs it into a single output line This process is Technical terminology termed multiplexing An electronic multiplexer makes it possible for several signals to share one expensive device or other resource for example one A D converter or one communication line instead of having one device per input signal An analog multiplexer is a special type of analog switch that connects one signal selected from several inputs to a single output A digital multiplexer is a set of parallel switches with selector that selects one of the input digital channels to outputs into the single digital output channel The selector selects one of the input channels according to the digital command it receives In electronics a demultiplexer is a device taking a single input signal and selecting one of many data output lines which is connected to the single input A multiplexer is often used with a complementary demultiplexer on the receiving end An electronic multiplexer can be considered as a multiple input single output switch and a demultiplexer as a single input multiple output switch In telecommunications and signal processing a multiplexer is a device that combines several input information signals into one output signal which carries several communication channel s by means of some multiplexing multiplex technique A demultiplexer is in this context a device that takes a single input signal that carries many channels and separates the channels over multiple output signals One cost saving use for multiplexers is connecting a multiplexer and a demultiplexer The image to the right demonstrates this In this case the cost of implementing separate channels for each data source is more expensive than the cost of implementing the multiplexing demultiplexing functions At the receiving end of the data link a complementary demultiplexer is normally required to break single data stream back down into the original streams In some cases the far end system may have more functionality than a simple demultiplexer and so at the same time as the demultiplexing still exists logically it may never actually happen physically such as in network address translation where a number of Internet Protocol IP private network users are multiplexed over a single public IP address
