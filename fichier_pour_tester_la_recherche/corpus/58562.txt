 X ray crystallography is a way to see the D three dimensional structure of a molecule The electron cloud of an atom bends the X ray s slightly This makes a picture of the molecule that can be seen on a screen It can be used for both organic chemistry organic and inorganic chemistry inorganic molecules The sample is not destroyed in the process The technique was jointly invented by Sir William Bragg They won the Nobel Prize in Physics for Lawrence Bragg is the youngest to be made a Nobel Laureate He was the Director of the Cavendish Laboratory Cambridge University when the discovery of the structure of DNA was made by James D Watson and Francis Crick in February The oldest method of X ray crystallography is X ray diffraction X rays are fired at a single crystal and the way they are scattered produces a pattern These patterns are used to work out the arrangement of atoms inside the crystal
