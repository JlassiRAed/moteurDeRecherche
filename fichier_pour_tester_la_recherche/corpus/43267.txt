The molecular clock is a technique which estimates when two taxa diverged in evolution It is based on comparing the detailed structure of key molecule s The method may be done for species or any higher taxon such as phyla Adjustments are made by using what is known of the fossil record The molecular Information data used for such calculations is often nucleotide sequences in genome analysis or amino acid sequences for protein s such as haemoglobin It is sometimes called a gene clock or evolutionary clock
