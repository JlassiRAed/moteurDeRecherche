 Logistic Regression also known as Logit Regression or Logit Model is a mathematical model used in statistics to estimate So given some feature x it tries to find out whether some event y happens or not So y can either be or In the case where the event happens y is given the value If the event does not happen then y is given the value of For example if y represents whether a sports teams wins a match then y will be if they win the match or y will be if they do not This is known as Binomial Logistic Regression There is also another form of Logistic Regression which uses multiple values for the variable y This form of Logistic Regression is known as Multinomial Logistic Regression Logistic Regression uses the logistic function to find a model that fits with the data points The function gives a S shaped curve to model the data The curve is restricted between and so it is easy to apply when y is binary Logistic Regression can then model events better than linear regression as it shows the probability for y being for a given x value Logistic Regression is used in statistics and machine learning to predict values of an input from previous test data
