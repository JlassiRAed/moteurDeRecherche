 Euphrosyne is one of the biggest Asteroid belt main belt asteroid s found by James Ferguson Euphrosyne one of the Charites in Greek mythology It is the eighth biggest main belt asteroid and contains around of the mass of the entire asteroid belt but is a very dark body near the belt s farther edge Because of that Euphrosyne is never visible with binoculars having a maximum magnitude at the best possible opposition of around which is actually fainter than any of the thirty asteroids previously found It has not been studied a lot despite being one of the biggest asteroids It is a normal C type asteroid with a primitive surface Its orbit however is quite unusual It s orbit is similar to that of Pallas in its high inclination and eccentricity Whereas Pallas and Eris Eris the only bigger bodies with comparably tilted orbits have nodes near perihelion and aphelion Euphrosyne s perihelion lies at the northernmost point of its orbit During a rare perihelic opposition Euphrosyne is very high in the sky from northern latitudes but invisible from such countries as New Zealand and Chile Its apparently low density suggests that unlike Hygiea Interamnia and Europa Euphrosyne is a loosely packed rubble pile Its rotation period is very common for big asteroids but nothing is known of its axial tilt
