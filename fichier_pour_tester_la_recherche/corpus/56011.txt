A hamming code is an Error detection and correction error correcting block code The code is named after Richard Hamming who developed it in the s At the time Hamming worked with machines that had relay s and used punched card s to read the data Because they were heavily used the punched cards often had errors which needed to be corrected by employees Hamming codes are used for digital signal processing and telecommunication s Hamming codes are generated according to certain rules Hamming codes use multiple parity bit s A parity bit tells whether a group of bits is even or odd In a hamming code each bit of data is covered by several parity bits This allows to detect errors and in certain cases to correct them as well A hamming code uses redundancy If there are three parity bits per code word the code word must have a length of The shortest possible Hamming code is parity bits are used for one data bit This code has two valid values and The codes and are transmission errors and will be assigned to the valid code word The other possibilities and will be changed to
