A synchrotron is a type of particle accelerator where particles travel around many times in a circle It uses a magnetic field to turn the particles in the circle and the electric field to accelerate the particles The components are carefully synchronized with the travelling particle beam Mark Oliphant invented the proton synchrotron Vladimir Veksler was the first to publish the idea Edwin McMillan constructed the first electron synchrotron
