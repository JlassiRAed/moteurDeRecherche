The Solar Wind Composition Experiment The experiment was suggested by by a Swiss team headed by Johannes Geiss of the University of Bern and Peter Eberhardt of the ETH Zurich Swiss Institute of Technology It was partially funded by the Swiss Government The SWC experiment was done by getting a aluminum sheet and facing it towards the sun The foil was to collect the ion types and energies of the solar wind on the lunar surface After the experiment the sheet was placed into a Polytetrafluoroethylene Teflon bag and sent back to Earth to be studied The experiment was successful and found Helium Neon and Argon isotopic compositions coming from the sun
