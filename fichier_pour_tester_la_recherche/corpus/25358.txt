A longitudinal wave is a wave parallel to the direction of the wave propagation This means that the particles move left and right which in turn makes the other particles start to oscillate This creates a wave Longitudinal waves are also called pressure waves and sound wave s are the most common kinds As with other waves the particle s do not move with the wave
