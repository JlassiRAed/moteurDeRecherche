The centromere is a special region of a chromosome usually near the middle It is where the two identical sister chromatid s stay in contact as the chromosome attaches to the spindle in mitosis The region contains specific types of DNA which are tandem repetitive sequences These sequences bind specific proteins called cen proteins During mitosis the centromeres can be seen during the metaphase stage as a constriction at the chromosome At this centromeric constriction the two halves of the chromosome the sister chromatids are held together until late metaphase
