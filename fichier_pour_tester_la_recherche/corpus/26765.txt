In Mechanics astrodynamics orbital eccentricity shows how much the shape of an object s orbit is different from a circle comment out really complex informationIn astrodynamics under standard assumptions in astrodynamics standard assumptions any orbit must be of conic section shape The eccentricity eccentricity of this conic section the orbit s eccentricity is an important parameter of the orbit that defines its absolute shape Eccentricity may be interpreted as a measure of how much this shape deviates from a circle Eccentricity is defined for all circle circular ellipse elliptic parabola parabolic and hyperbolic trajectory hyperbolic orbit s It can take the following values for circular orbit s is equal to zero for Ellipse elliptic orbits is more than zero but less than for parabolic trajectories is equal to for hyperbolic trajectory hyperbolic trajectories is more than
