 Image Pi eq C over d svg thumb right xpx Pi is a mathematical constant It is the ratio of the distance around a circle to the circle s diameter This produces a number and that number is always the same However the number is rather strange The number starts and continues without end Numbers like this are called Irrational number irrational numbers The diameter is the longest straight line which can be fitted inside a circle It passes through the center of the circle The distance around a circle is known as the circumference Even though the diameter and circumference are different for different circles the number pi remains constant its value never changes This is because the relationship between the circumference and diameter is always the same
