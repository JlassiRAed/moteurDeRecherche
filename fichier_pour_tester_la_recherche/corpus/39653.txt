 Odontochelys is the oldest known turtle to have been discovered It was first described from three million year old specimens excavated in Upper Triassic Rock rocks in Guizhou China As a primitive turtle Odontochelys differed from modern turtles in several ways Modern turtles possess a horny beak without any teeth in their mouth In contrast Odontochelys fossils had teeth in their upper and lower jaws One of the most striking features of turtles both modern and prehistoric alike are their dorsal Turtles Shell shells forming an armored carapace over the body of the animal Odontochelys only had the bottom portion of a turtle s armor the plastron It did not yet have a solid carapace as most other turtles do Instead of a solid carapace Odontochelys had broadened ribs like those of modern turtle embryos that still have not started developing the Ossification ossified plates of a carapace In a comparison of skull proportions the skull of Odontochelys is far more elongated in front of the eyes compared to other turtles The tail of the prehistoric turtle was longer in proportion to its body than other turtles In addition the transverse process es found in the tail are not fused such as in later turtles Taken together these anatomical differences mean that Odontochelys has some of the most primitive features ever seen in a turtle and is somewhat of a transitional fossil and that the shell became reversed Such shells can be seen on modern turtles like the leatherback turtle s It is likely that Odontochelys was aquatic as the fossil specimens were found in marine deposits full of conodont s and ammonite s The primitive turtle swam in shallow marine waters close to shore The species name Odontochelys semitestacea literally means toothed turtle with a half shell an apt description of its most striking physical characteristics
