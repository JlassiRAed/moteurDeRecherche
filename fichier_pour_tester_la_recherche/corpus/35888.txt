 Hipparchus was a Ancient Greece Greek astronomer geographer and mathematician He lived in the Hellenistic period Hipparchus was born in Nicaea and probably died on the island of Rhodes He worked as an astronomer at least from BC to BC Hipparchus is considered the greatest ancient astronomical observer Some people see him as the greatest overall astronomer of classical antiquity antiquity He was the first Greek whose quantitative and accurate models for the motion of the Sun and Moon survive To get to these models he certainly made use of the observations and perhaps the mathematical techniques accumulated over centuries by the Chaldea ns from Babylonia He had a trigonometry trigonometric table It looks like he solved some problems of Polar coordinate system spherical trigonometry with the table With his solar and lunar theories and his trigonometry he was perhaps the first to develop a reliable method to predict solar eclipse s His other well known achievements include the discovery of precession the compilation of the first comprehensive star catalog of the western world and possibly the invention of the astrolabe He might also have invented the armillary sphere which first appeared during his century and was used by him during the creation of much of the star catalogue It would be three centuries before Ptolemy Claudius Ptolemaeus synthesis of astronomy would make the work of Hipparchus obsolete it is heavily dependent on it in many areas
