A razor is a tool with one or more blade s used by men for shaving the hair from their face and by women for shaving hair from their legs and underarms The earliest razors known are from the Bronze Age They were made of bronze and had an oval shape There are different kinds of razors today including straight razors which are rarely used and safety razors and electric razors A slightly different type of electric razor is used to trim and cut hair from the head because hair can be cut much more quickly with electric haircutting razors than with scissors
