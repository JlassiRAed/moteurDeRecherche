 The Proteobacteria are a major phylum of bacteria It is named after the Greek god Proteus who could change his shape because of the great diversity of forms found in this group They are gram negative bacteria This means they do not retain the violet dye in the Gram stain ing protocol In a Gram stain test a counterstain is added after the crystal violet colouring all gram negative bacteria with a pink colour The test itself is useful in classifying two distinct types of bacteria based on the structural differences of their cell wall s Proteobacteria include a wide variety of pathogen s such as Escherichia coli Salmonella Vibrio Helicobacter and many other notable genera Others are free living and include many of the bacteria responsible for nitrogen fixation The group is defined primarily in terms of ribosomal RNA sequences Most members are facultatively or obligately anaerobic chemoautotroph s and heterotroph ic but there are numerous exceptions There are alphaproteobacteria in this phylum which are widely found in Ocean marine plankton They may constitute over of the open ocean microbial community
