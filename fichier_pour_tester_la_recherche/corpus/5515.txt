A thioester is a molecule with a functional group group C S CO C They are like ester s but with a sulfur atom instead of an oxygen one Like esters they can be made from carboxylic acid s In the synthesis a thiol is used instead of an alcohol Thioesters are very important in biochemistry They are made in the body during chemical reaction reactions that make fatty acid s They are also important intermediate s in the production of ATP which is the molecule that gives energy to the body In chemistry thioesters can be also used as electrophile s They are more reactive than esters and amide s They can also do aldol reaction s
