 Cell biology is the study of how living cell s work This includes the structure and function of the cell organelle s and the carbon based molecule s which cells produce Cell biology is an interdisciplinary subject and uses ideas from genetics biochemistry molecular biology immunology and other subjects and techniques The most important molecules in cell biology are DNA RNA and protein s The most important structures in the cell are the Cell nucleus nucleus and the chromosome s but there are others The structure of eukaryote eukaryotic cells is much more complex than prokaryote prokaryotic cells This is because endosymbiosis has occurred some or all of the eukaryote organelles are former prokaryotes Examples are mitochondria and plastid s The most important function of cells is to cell division divide by mitosis or meiosis Cells in a multicellular organism also specialise in Differentiation different functions and the different types may look quite to each other Cytology is mostly about the appearance and structure of cells
