An H II region is a region where huge OB star blue stars are formed from hydrogen They are named after the ionization ionised atom ic hydrogen which they produce H II The star formation stars form inside a large cloud of hydrogen gas The short lived blue stars formed in these regions give off huge amounts of ultraviolet light This ionizes the surrounding gas H II regions can be several hundred light year s across The first known H II region was the Orion nebula which was discovered in These regions have extremely varied shapes They often appear clumpy and filamentary sometimes showing bizarre shapes such as the Horsehead nebula H II regions give birth to thousands of stars over several million years Eventually this produces a star cluster In the end supernova explosions and strong stellar wind s from the most massive stars blow away the gases of the H II region This leaves behind behind a cluster of stars such as the Pleiades H II regions can be seen at huge distances in the universe The study of extragalactic H II regions helps to fix the distance and chemical composition of other galaxy galaxies Spiral galaxy Spiral and irregular galaxy irregular galaxies have many H II regions while elliptical galaxy elliptical galaxies have almost none In spiral galaxies like the Milky Way H II regions are found in the spiral arm s but in the irregular galaxies they are distributed at random Some galaxies have huge H II regions with tens of thousands of stars Examples include the Doradus region in the Large Magellanic Cloud and NGC in the Triangulum galaxy
