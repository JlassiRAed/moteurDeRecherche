We do not have a theory of everything It is a hope for the future The basic concept of the theory of everything is that one theory could explain every aspect of physics The four basic forces of nature are gravity the strong force the weak force and the electromagnetism electromagnetic force The theory of general relativity explains gravity and quantum mechanics explains the other three forces Right now no one theory that everyone accepts can explain all four forces String theory is a theory that could become the theory of everything
