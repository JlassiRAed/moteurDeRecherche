A black hole is a region of space from which nothing including light can escape According to the general relativity general theory of relativity it is the result of the curving of spacetime caused by a very dense mass Around a black hole there is a position of no return called the event horizon It is called black because it absorbs all the light that hits it reflecting nothing just like a perfect black body in thermodynamics Under the theory of quantum mechanics black holes have a temperature and emit Hawking radiation which makes them slowly get smaller A black hole is found by its interaction with matter A black hole can be inference inferred by tracking the movement of a group of stars that orbit a region in space Alternatively when gas falls into a black hole caused by a binary star companion star or nebula the gas spirals inward heating to very high temperatures and emitting large amounts of radiation This radiation can be detected from earthbound and Earth orbiting telescope s Astronomers have identified numerous stellar black hole candidates and have also found evidence of supermassive black hole s at the center of every galaxy After observing the motion of nearby stars for years in astronomers found compelling evidence that a supermassive black hole of more than million solar mass es is located near the Sagittarius A region in the center of the Milky Way galaxy
