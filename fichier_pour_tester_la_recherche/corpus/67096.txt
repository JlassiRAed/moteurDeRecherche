 Malthusianism is a set of ideas developed by Reverend Thomas Malthus Thomas Robert Malthus Malthus was an economist who lived during the industrial revolution In Mathus published a book called An Essay on the Principle of Population In it he describes the Malthusian growth model He wrote that the growth of the population is exponential The growth of the food supply however is only arithmetical This means if there are no limits to the growth of the population that it will not be possible to produce food for all of them This is known as Malthusian catastrophe Malthus wrote during the time of the Manchester School of thought The Tory party had paternalism paternalistic ideas such as Charity The act brought the construction of workhouse s despite riots and arson By that time the ideas were widespread in progressive social circles One supporter was the novelist Harriet Martineau whose circle of acquaintances included Charles Darwin The ideas of Malthus were a significant influence on the inception of Darwin s theory According to Dr Dan Ritschel of the Center for History Education at the University of Maryland The great Malthusian dread was that indiscriminate charity would lead to exponential growth in the population in poverty increased charges to the public purse to support this growing army of the dependent and eventually the catastrophe of national bankruptcy Though Malthusianism has since come to be identified with the issue of general over population the original Malthusian concern was more specifically with the fear of over population by the dependent poor One of the earliest critics of Malthusian theory was Karl Marx who referred to it as nothing more than a schoolboyish superficial plagiary of De Foe Sir James Steuart Townsend Franklin Wallace and others postulating that progress in science and technology would allow for indefinite exponential population growth Many people today still believe that Mathus was right about human population growth getting out of hand
