The evolution of the peppered moth has been studied in detail over the last years At first almost all of the moths were light colour ed This gave them camouflage against the light coloured trees and lichens where they rested during the day As pollution increased during the Industrial Revolution in England many of the lichens died out The trees became blackened by soot and most of the light coloured moths or typica became rare At the same time the dark coloured or melanic moths carbonaria flourished This change took place because it was the best camouflaged moths which survived better The term industrial melanism refers to the genetic darkening of species in response to pollutant s Since then with an improved environment light coloured peppered moths have again become common As a result of the relatively simple and easy to understand circumstances of the adaptation the peppered moth has become a common example used in explaining or demonstrating natural selection cite web url title The Peppered Moth the proof of darwinian evolution accessdate author Majerus M E N
