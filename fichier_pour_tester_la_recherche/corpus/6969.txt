 Zipf s law is an Empiricism empirical law formulated using mathematical statistics The law is named after the linguistics linguist George Kingsley Zipf who first proposed it Zipf s law states that given a large sample of words used the frequency of any word is inverse ly proportional to its rank in the frequency table So word number N has a frequency of N Thus the most frequent word will occur about twice as often as the second most frequent word three times as often as the third most frequent word etc For example in one sample of words the most frequently occurring word accounts for nearly of all the words Only vocabulary items are needed to account for half the sample of words The same relationship occurs in many other rankings unrelated to language such as the population ranks of cities in various countries corporation sizes income rankings etc The appearance of the distribution in rankings of cities by population was first noticed by Felix Auerbach in It is not known why Zipf s law holds for most languages
