 Protein structure describes how protein molecules are organised This structure is what makes proteins work Proteins are important biological macromolecule s present in all organism s They are polymers formed from possible amino acid s by RNA translation Protein structures range in size from tens to several thousand amino acids After translation proteins fold into specific shapes This is not done by chemical bond s but by weaker forces such as hydrogen bond s To understand how proteins work it is often necessary to discover their three dimensional structure To do this biophysics uses techniques such as X ray crystallography NMR spectroscopy and Interferometer dual polarisation interferometry A protein may switch from one shape to another as it does its job The alternative states of the same protein are called Conformational isomerism conformation s An enzyme for instance will have at least two conformations one with its co enzyme and one without The form with its coenzyme will have two conformations one with its Substrate substrate and one without
