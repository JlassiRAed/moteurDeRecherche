 Transitional fossils are the fossil ised remains of lifeforms that show features typical of two distinct groups It may be a rare fossil such as Archaeopteryx which shows early features of a group which later becomes widespread The rarity of transitional forms is interesting It suggests the new forms are not yet dominant in the ecology of their time and their populations are relatively small It follows that their fossils would be scarce In the Solnhofen limestone where Archaeopteryx was found there are more examples of pterosaur s of several genera than there are of the proto bird In the Jurassic the pterosaurs were dominant in the air But in the Lower Cretaceous the situation is reversed The pterosaurs are in decline and large numbers of different bird species are found in the famous Chinese lagerstatte n deposits such as the Jehol biota The Lower Cretaceous birds are clearly more bird like and the features they developed evidently evidently enabled them to invade habitat niche s which had been the preserve of pterosaurs or maybe were not previously exploited at all
