 Elevated building foundation is a kind of seismic base isolation technology which is made a major part of a building superstructure It is made to protect the building s superstructure against damage from the shaking caused by an earthquake This goal can be met with the right building materials size and setup of EBF for the building site and local soil conditions As a result of multiple wave reflection s and diffractions as well as energy dissipation of the seismic waves as they move up through the EBF any movement of seismic wave energy into the building superstructure will be decreased which will lower seismic load s and improve seismic performance of the structure In other words the building does not shake as much because it is sitting on the elevated building foundation and will probably take less damage from the earthquake
