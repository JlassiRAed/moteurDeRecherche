 Applied mathematics is a field of mathematics which uses mathematics to solve problem s of other branches of science There are many fields Approximation theory Sometimes it is not possible to get an exact solution to a problem because this might take too long or it may not be possible at all Approximation theory looks at ways to get a solution which is close to the exact one and which can be obtained faster Probability and Statistics How likely is it that something will happen If a coin is flipped times and lands heads up times is this coin good for games of chance or should another one be taken Optimization is about finding better solutions to problems In ecology certain things are known about populations of animals or plants This is usually called Population model Biologists use them to tell how a population changes over time
