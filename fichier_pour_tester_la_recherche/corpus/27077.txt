A session key is a single use Symmetric key algorithm symmetric key used for encryption encrypting all message s in one Session communication session A closely related term is traffic encryption key or TEK which refers to any Symmetric key algorithm symmetric key that is used to encryption encrypt traffic messages Typically TEK s are changed frequently in some systems daily and in others for every message Session keys introduce complexities in a cryptosystem However they also help with some real problems which is why they are used There are two primary reasons for using session keys First several Cryptanalysis cryptanalytic attacks are made easier as more ciphertext encryption encrypted with a specific key is available By limiting the number of messages encryption encrypted using a single key those attacks are made more difficult Like all Key properly is a major drawback in any cryptosystem
