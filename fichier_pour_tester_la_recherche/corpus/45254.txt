 Transonic means breaking the sound barrier by travelling faster than the speed of sound The speed of flight is divided into four groups based on speed Subsonic Transonic Supersonic Hypersonic Transonic means going from subsonic to supersonic Subsonic ends and supersonic begins at mach so transonic goes from mach to When you are going through transonic speeds Drag drag increases and it is really hard to go any faster This is the sound barrier science stub
