An open star cluster also known as galactic cluster is a star cluster group of a few hundred or thousand star s They have roughly the same age and were formed from the same giant molecular cloud More than open clusters have been discovered within the Milky Way Galaxy and many more are thought to exist They are loosely bound together by mutual gravity gravitational attraction but they get disrupted by close encounters with other clusters and clouds of gas Open clusters generally survive for a few hundred million years with the most massive ones surviving for a few billion years In contrast the more massive globular cluster s of stars exert a stronger gravitational attraction on their members and can survive for longer Open clusters have been found only in spiral galaxy spiral and irregular galaxy irregular galaxies in which active star formation is occurring Payne Gaposchkin C Stars and clusters Cambridge Mass Harvard University Press Young open clusters may still be in the molecular cloud from which they formed They light it up and create an H II region Over time radiation pressure from the cluster will disperse the molecular cloud Typically about of the mass of a gas cloud will form stars before radiation pressure drives the rest of the gas away Open clusters are key objects in the study of stellar evolution Because the cluster members are of similar age and chemical element chemical composition their properties Hyades or the Alpha Persei Cluster are visible with the naked eye Neata Emil Open Star Clusters Information and Observations Night Sky Info
