A polymer is a molecule made from joining together many small molecules called monomer s The word polymer can be broken down into poly bonded together into a larger molecule A chemical reaction bonding monomers together to make a polymer is called polymerization Some polymers are natural and made by organism s Protein s have polypeptide molecules which are natural polymers made from various amino acid monomer units Nucleic acid s are huge natural polymers made up of millions of nucleotide units Cellulose and starch are also natural polymers made up of glucopyranose monomer bonded together in different ways Some polymers are man made Plastic s rubber and fiber s are made up of polymers If the units called monomers in a polymer are all the same then the polymer is called a homopolymer Homopolymers are named by adding the prefix poly before the monomer name from which the polymer is made For example a polymer made by bonding styrene monomer molecules together is called polystyrene If the monomers are not all the same the polymer is called a copolymer or a heteropolymer Many polymer molecules are like chains where the monomer units are the links Polymer molecules can be straight chain have branching from the main chain or cross linking between chains As an example of cross linking sulfhydryl joining the chains together
