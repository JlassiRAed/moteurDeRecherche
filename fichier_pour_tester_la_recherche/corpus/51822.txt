A meritocracy is the condition where people who deserve to can go up in rank as opposed to a system like nepotism It applies generally to all positions to which people may be appointed It is often reinforced by law s such as that women should have equal opportunities to men in employment The philosopher Plato thought that a government based on merit was better than democracy In democracy there is no guarantee that you will get the best person the most qualified person ruling the state His criticisms were really of Athenian democracy where anyone could be selected to rule In a meritocracy the people are chosen who are thought to be the best Some have accused it of being elitist saying that government by the best will mean that only those who have had the right opportunities will have a chance to govern creating in effect a ruling class It is worth pointing out that Plato did not see it this way He believed that philosophers were the best people to rule because they were disinterested meaning they only had the interests of the state in mind not their own interest Plato s point was this if you want to rule then it will go wrong because power will corrupt you If you are a philosopher you don t care about power all you care about is truth so you will rule well without being interested in your power or status
