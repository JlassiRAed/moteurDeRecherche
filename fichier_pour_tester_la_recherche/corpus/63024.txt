In developmental biology cellular differentiation is the process by which a less specialized cell tissues have different kinds of cells Differentiation occurs many times during the development of a multicellular organism as the organism changes from a single zygote to a complex system of tissues and cell types Differentiation is a common process in adults as well adult stem cell s divide and create fully differentiated Cell division daughter cells during tissue repair and during normal cell turnover Differentiation dramatically changes a cell s size shape metabolism metabolic activity and responsiveness to signals These changes are largely due to highly controlled modifications in gene expression With a few exceptions cellular differentiation almost never involves a change in the DNA sequence itself It does involve switching off many gene s not needed in a particular tissue Thus cells in different tissues may have very different physical characteristics despite having the same genome A cell that is able to differentiate into many cell types is known as pluripotent Such cells are called stem cell s in animals and meristem meristematic cells in higher plants A cell that is able to differentiate into all cell types is known as totipotent In mammals only the zygote and early embryo nic cells are totipotent while in plants many differentiated cells can become totipotent with simple laboratory techniques
