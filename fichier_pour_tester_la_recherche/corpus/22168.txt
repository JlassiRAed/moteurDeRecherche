The Riemann sphere is a mathematical model of the extended complex plane The model is named after Bernhard Riemann The extended complex plane is the Plane plane of the complex number s plus a point at infinity With this model this point at infinity is close to very large numbers in the same way zero is close to very small ones The extended complex numbers are useful for Complex analysis in certain cases the division by zero is well behaved in the sense that dividing by zero gives this point at infinity With this model it is possible to change certain functions so that they become Continuous function continuous which simplifies calculation In geometry the Riemann sphere is a simple example of a Riemann surface It is also one of the simplest complex manifold s
