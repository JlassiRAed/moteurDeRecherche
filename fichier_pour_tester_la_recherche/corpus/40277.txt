In cryptography the key space of an algorithm refers to the set of all possible Key keys that can be used to initialize the Cryptography cryptographic algorithm For example if an algorithm works using a key that is a string of bit s then its key space is the set of all binary numeral system binary strings of length bits i e we have key space of size To avoid attackers from guessing the key using a Brute force attack brute force attack the key space is usually designed to be very large Another needed attribute is that the key space designed to be flat having no or very few weak key s
