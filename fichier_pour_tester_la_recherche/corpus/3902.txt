A clot is a semi solid substance that blood forms especially when it is in air When a person bleeds the blood turns into a clot at the injury A blood clot is also called a thrombus The process is called coagulation If a person gets a cut on their body that person may bleed To stop the bleeding the human body does several things First the brain orders the liver to produce chemicals that will help the clot to form When the chemicals released by the liver arrive at the injury the coagulation begins In the mean time the brain also lessens the blood flow near the injury so that not as much blood is lost There is a limit to how quickly a clot can form If the cut is very deep and the person bleeds too much a clot may not be able to form and a lot of blood may be lost
