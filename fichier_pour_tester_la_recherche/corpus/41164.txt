A Bantustan The founders of apartheid tried hard to make the Bantustans recognised internationally but this never happened and most blacks did not like the Bantustans They were unpopular because The borders of the Bantustans were drawn to exclude valuable land The large number of reassigned citizens combined with the small size of the Bantustans meant that the citizen to land ratio was severely disproportionate to that of South Africa Becoming citizens of the new territories meant losing citizenship of South Africa where the majority of candidates for reassignment of citizenship lived and worked This would cause them to lose what few rights and privileges they had as citizens of South Africa The Bantustans were dissolved in and their territory incorporated into the Republic of South Africa From most parts of the country were redivided into new provinces
