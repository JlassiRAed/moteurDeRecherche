 Tanakh is an acronym that is almost the same thing as saying the Hebrew Bible It has three parts called the Torah which has the first five books the Nevi im which has the books of Hebrews Hebrew prophets and the Ketuvim which has the rest of the books It takes its name from the first letter of each of these parts The Tanakh is the Jewish holy book although most would say the Torah is but it is just the most important part out of the three parts of the Tanakh
