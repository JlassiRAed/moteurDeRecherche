In chemistry a cyclic compound is a molecule where some atom s are linked together forming a loop or ring Most of the time these molecules are organic chemistry organic There are also many examples of inorganic chemistry inorganic molecule forming rings Cyclic compounds can be aromatic hydrocarbon aromatic in this case they are flat Benzene is a simple aromatic cyclic compound When they are not aromatic rings tend not to be flat to avoid steric effects Image cycloheptane sticks png Cycloheptane a non aromatic cyclic compound Image Benzol svg Benzene an aromatic cyclic compound Image Cyclohexane chair D stereo skeletal png Cyclohexane drawn in the chair conformationCyclic compounds are very important Many drug s are based on them like aspirin There are many chemical reaction reactions that can make or break cyclic compounds One important class of these is pericyclic reaction s
