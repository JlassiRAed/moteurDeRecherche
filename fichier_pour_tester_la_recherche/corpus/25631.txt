 Magnetic flux is always zero This implies that there cannot be magnetic charges in classical electromagnetic The SI unit of measurement unit of magnetic flux is the Weber The Centimeter gram second system of units CGS unit is the Maxwell Maxwell Magnetic flux is sometimes used by electrical engineers designing systems with electromagnet s or designing dynamo s Physicists designing particle accelerator s also calculate magnetic flux
