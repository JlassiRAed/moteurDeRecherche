In molecular biology complementarity is a wikt property property of nucleic acid s such as DNA and RNA Each nucleotide has a nitrogenous base and each nitrogenous base can pair up with the nitrogenous base from another different nucleotide One can say that the nitrogenous base is complementary to the other in that the base pair s between them are non covalent bond covalently bonded by hydrogen bond s Since there is only one complementary base for any of the bases found in DNA and in RNA enzyme s can make a complementary strand from any single strand This is needed for DNA replication The bases which are complementary areFor example the complementary strand of the DNA sequenceis
