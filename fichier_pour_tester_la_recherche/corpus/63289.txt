The structure of the Earth is divided into layer s These layers are both physically and chemically different The Earth has an outer solid Crust mantle a liquid outer core and a solid inner core The shape of the earth is an oblate spheroid because it is slightly flattened at the geographical pole poles and bulging at the equator The boundaries between these layers were discovered by seismograph s which showed the way vibrations bounced off the layers during earthquakes Between the Earth s crust and the mantle is a boundary called the moho It was the first discovery of a major change in the Earth s structure as one goes deeper The crust is the outermost layer of the Earth It is made of List of rocks solid rocks It is mostly made of the lighter elements silicon oxygen aluminium Because of this it is known as sial or felsic The mantle is the layer of the Earth right below the crust It is made mostly of oxygen silicon and the heavier element magnesium It is known as siam or mafic The mantle itself is divided into layers The uppermost part of the mantle is solid and forms the base of the crust It is made of the heavy rock peridotite The continental and oceanic plates include both the crust proper and this uppermost solid layer of the mantle Together this mass makes up the lithosphere The lithosphere plates float on the semi liquid aesthenosphere below Upper aesthenosphere magma Lower aesthenosphere Lower mantle The core is made of solid iron and nickel and is about C Outer core is a liquid layer below the mantle Inner core is the very center of the Earth It is very hot and due to the high pressure it is solid A full explanation of these effects is not yet clear It seems that with the increasing heat and pressure comes changes in the crystallization of minerals so that the composition might be a kind of changing mixture of liquid and crystals
