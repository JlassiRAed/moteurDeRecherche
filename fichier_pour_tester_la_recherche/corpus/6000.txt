OEM stands for Original Equipment Manufacturing It is mainly used to describe parts for car s airplane s and electrical systems It is also used for computer parts and computer program s The name OEM is usually used when a new version of something is made by a company that is different to the company that first made it The new company will sell the product at a cheaper price but this is often because it does not have as many features as the first version For example an OEM computer program will usually only come with the disc and a licence but no instruction manuals
