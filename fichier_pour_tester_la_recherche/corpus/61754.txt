 Permineralization is a process of fossil ization in which mineral deposits form internal Casting casts of organisms Minerals in water fill the spaces inside organic tissue The process gives a record of soft tissue as well as hard tissues Fossils with permineralization are useful in studying internal structures especially of plants Mani K Permineralization in Fossils a window to the past Water from the ground lakes or oceans seeps into the pores of organic tissue and forms a crystal cast with deposited minerals Crystals begin to form in the porous cell walls This process continues on the inner surface of the walls until the central cavity of the cell the Lumen lumen is completely filled The cell walls themselves remain intact surrounding the crystals Permineralization is different from petrification in that the organic material is only filled with minerals and not completely replaced Permineralization can occur in several ways
