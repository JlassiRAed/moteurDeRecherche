Wikipedia is a big place with many editors all with their own opinions on how to do things It may seem surprising that we d be able to work together but somehow this is what usually happens One of our important guidelines that reminds editors to work together is WP AGF assume good faith This is good advice because it tells us that when we disagree usually everyone involved is trying to do what they really think is best Sure we get WP VANDAL people who harm the project on purpose sometimes but they re usually easy to deal with They can be blocked from editing if needed with little trouble and often without more arguments We often see bigger disputes where editors are disruptive while trying to help This can cause harm to our ideas of assuming good faith Some editors focus on good faith so much that they might think that is all you need to take part here But that isn t quite true wikt competence Competence is required also that is editors need to understand what they are writing about Every editor is incompetent in some areas so it is good to be aware of what you can and cannot do well
