 Terminal velocity is the speed when a falling object is no longer getting faster Velocity means how fast something is changing position in both speed and direction Terminal velocity happens at the moment in time that the force because of gravity called weight is the same as the opposite force of Drag equals zero An object continues to fall steadily until air resistance becomes so great that it equals with the pull of gravity and the object can fall no faster
