 Scroll lock is the name of a key on a computer keyboard that was meant to lock all scrolling methods The scroll lock key is rarely used and only came about because the original IBM PC keyboard had it It was supposed to change how the arrow keys work For example when the scroll lock mode was turned on the arrow keys would scroll the contents of a text Window window instead of moving the cursor Today the key doesn t do anything in most Computer program programs and as a result many keyboards today especially those on laptop s do not have the scroll lock key
