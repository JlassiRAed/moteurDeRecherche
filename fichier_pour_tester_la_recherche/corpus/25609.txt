A genetic algorithm is an algorithm that wikt imitation imitates the process of natural selection Natural selection is a central concept of evolution some organism s have traits that will make it more likely that the organism survives long enough to reproduce That way it is likely that these traits will be passed on to the next generation This has also been called survival of the fittest Genetic algorithms are often used to find solutions for Optimization optimization and search problems Genetic algorithms are part of the broader class of evolutionary algorithm s Genetic algorithms imitate the same mechanisms as those found in nature that is to say Heredity inheritance mutation selection and Crossing over crossover
