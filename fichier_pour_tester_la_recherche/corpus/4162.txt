In Object oriented programming languages inheritance is a way to add functionality Object oriented programming has the notion of classes A derived class inherits most fields and methods from its parent class It can modify the behaviour of the parent by adding new fields and methods or by modifying existing ones Depending on the programming language used there may be certain restrictions when extending a class Inheritance can be used to solve different types of problems An example can be a Car class You could create a Ferrari class which would inherit from Car and also make a Toyota class which would also inherit from Car This way all the fields and methods would also be inside of Ferrari and Toyota and you wouldn t need to copy the code twice However maybe inside of Car you could have a brand field This brand field would be equal to nothing but inside of Ferrari the field might be equal to ferrari and in Toyota to toyota Of course you could not just create a Car because otherwise that field would be missing In order to prevent people from just creating a Car you turn the Car into an abstract class
