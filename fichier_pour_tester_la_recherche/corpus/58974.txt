 The Viking program was a NASA mission that sent two spacecraft to the planet Mars These spacecraft were called Viking and Viking Each spacecraft was made of an orbiter and a lander lander The orbiters took picture s of Mars while going around the planet and gave information to Earth The landers gathered scientific data on the surface of the planet Both Viking spacecraft were launched in and both reached Mars in Scientist s chose a landing places for both landers from the pictures that the orbiters had taken Then the landers were loosed from the orbiters and they went down to their landing places The orbiters still took pictures while the landers studied the surface of the planet and did other things All of the spacecraft including both orbiters and both landers kept working for longer than they had been planned to But eventually they broke down Viking Orbiter broke down in Viking Orbiter and Viking Lander in and Viking Lander in The Viking program was the most expensive and difficult mission ever sent to Mars The program cost a total of US billion The program was very successful Most of the knowledge about Mars until the late s came from the Viking mission
