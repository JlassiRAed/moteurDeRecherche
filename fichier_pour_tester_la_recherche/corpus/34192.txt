Welcome to the first ever QandA on the Simple English Signpost This should be a good idea Every month User Kennedy will interview someone asking them about themselves and their opinions on Wikipedia So look out for the monthly interview featuring some top editors soon Lets kick off with our first user User Microchip So tell me a little about yourself where you are from what do you do I m Microchip from Hampshire I ve been actively editing for about six months but have had an account for about a year I m part of the Small Wiki Monitoring Team so I ve now got an account on a ridiculous number of WMF projects I ve got accounts on various Wikimedias but only about six I edit regularly Tell us what is the Small Wiki Monitoring team It s a small project run mainly by the Counter Vandalism Unit which reverts vandalism on small wikis of the WMF You can help revert vandalism by joining cvn sw Thats good So what got you into editing on Wikipedia My first edit was at on Oct here I started editing ENWP in earnest in April next year I started editing in order to be different as no one else I knew was editing Wikimedia I soon discovered the Wikimedia Foundation and branched out onto a few other projects I don t edit them very often but I know they re there Is there anything you don t like about Wikipedia On EN it s the drama and the fact that there s no place for humour whereas on SEWP everyone s very lighhearted There s also no drama until this month but that s all over now I enjoy the fact that on SEWP you can create articles on EN you have to write about uber obscure things Once I somehow managed to get onto my watchlist was List of stamps of Japan with birds or something I ve got into the other Wikimedia projects recently and only SEWMF ones I m not going too close to q for obvious reasons but it s active wikt isn t my cup of tea so I m now working on Wikibooks Is there anything you are proud of doing in Wikipedia A favourite edit or something you are glad you got the chance to do I m proud of refactoring the template although I look at it now and it seems really easy but I enjoyed it I m glad I m part of SEWP if I hadn t heard of it I would have stopped editing Wikipedia ages ago Anyway I m definitely a m Metapedian metapedian I don t really know what else so I think that will do nicely Unless there is some questions you want to ask yourself Not that I can think of But a plug of b would be nice kennedy wonders if he should take up journalism No Please don t
