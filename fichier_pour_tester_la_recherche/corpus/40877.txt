 Gas chromatography is a type of chromatography The sample to be tested is first turned into a gas and then carried through a column by a nonreactive carrier gas such as helium or other inert gas such as nitrogen As the sample is carried through the column it is separated into its individual components To achieve this the column is housed inside an oven where the temperature is controlled to allow the individual components to exit the column at different times
