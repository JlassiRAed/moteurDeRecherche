The Doctrine of Implied repeal is an concept idea in Constitution of the United Kingdom English constitutional theory which states that an earlier Act of Parliament law cannot be used to amend or repeal a later law If two laws about the same subject say different things it will be the more recently enacted law that says what must be done This doctrine is expressed in the Latin phrase leges posteriores priores contrarias abrogant more recent law overwrites earlier law that says differently
