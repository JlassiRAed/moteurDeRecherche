 Conjugations are forms of verb s that are changed to agree with the subject that is doing the action described by the verb Usually most of the word stays the same but the endings change Most conjugation systems follow some sort of pattern within the language Example French language French verb for to eat manger the infinitive form of the verb would be used in this case The pattern here is that the er is removed from the verb and replaced with a different ending depending on the subject This pattern is good for many French conjugations but not all and in other language s conjugation patterns are going to be very different
