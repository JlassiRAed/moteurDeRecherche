 Bacterial conjugation is the transfer of genetics genetic material between bacterial cells by direct cell to cell contact or by a bridge like connection between two cells Conjugation is a mechanism of horizontal gene transfer as are Transformation transduction though these two other mechanisms do not involve cell to cell contact Bacterial conjugation was discovered by Nobel Prize winners Joshua Lederberg and Edward Tatum They showed that the bacterium Escherichia coli entered a sexual phase during which it could share genetic information Bacterial conjugation is often incorrectly regarded as the equivalent of sexual reproduction since it involves the exchange of genetic material During conjugation the donor cell provides a conjugative or mobilizable genetic element that is most often a plasmid or transposon Most conjugative plasmids have systems ensuring that the recipient cell does not already contain a similar element The genetic information transferred is often beneficial to the recipient Benefits may include antibiotic resistance xenobiotic tolerance or the ability to use new metabolite s Such beneficial plasmids may be considered bacterial endosymbiont s Other elements however may be viewed as bacterial parasitism parasites and conjugation as a mechanism evolved by them to allow for their spread
