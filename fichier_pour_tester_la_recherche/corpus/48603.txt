 The Standard Model of physics is a theory of the elementary particle s which are either fermion s or boson s It also explains three of the four Fundamental force basic forces of nature The four fundamental forces are gravity electromagnetism the weak force and the strong force Gravity is the one the model does not explain The model uses the parts of physics called quantum mechanics and special relativity and the ideas of field physical field and symmetry breaking Some of the mathematics of the SM is group theory and also as equations which have biggest and smallest points called Lagrangians and Hamiltonians
