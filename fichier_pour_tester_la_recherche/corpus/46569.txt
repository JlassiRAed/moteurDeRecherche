The atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were nuclear attacks on the Empire of Japan during World War II President of the United States U S President Harry S Truman ordered these attacks on August and Six days after the explosion over Nagasaki Japan surrendered to the Allied Powers on August Japan signed the surrender paper on September This officially ended the Pacific War and World War II Hiroshima and Nagasaki were chosen for several reasons First both cities were unsuitable for firebombing targets mainly due to the river deltas preventing the firestorms from being very effective Second both cities had terrains which provided a good measurement for damage caused by the nuclear bombs The vast majority of the people say that the atomic bombs actually saved many lives in the long run because it prevented the invasion of Japan Without the bombs the Allies would have had to invade Japan to end the war which would drag out for years More people would have been killed on both sides in a full battle in Japan Allied generals believed that an invasion of Japan would have killed more than a million people on each side Some say that the bombings were not necessary People still argue about this No nuclear weapon has ever been used in combat since August The decision to use nuclear weapons on Japan was made after an analysis showed that more than a million people combatants of both nations and civilians would die if Japan was invaded by Allied forces The nuclear bombings while shocking and unprecedented actually paled in comparison with the Operation Meetinghouse firebombing of Tokyo on March which killed civilians and destroyed square miles in a single night Had not for the nuclear weapons the U S would have resorted to firebombing Hiroshima and Nagasaki which would have caused equal amount of damage but did not produce the shock value that nuclear weapons have Partly because of the atomic bombings after the war Japan adopted the Three Non Nuclear Principles These principles said that Japan could not create or try to get nuclear weapons
