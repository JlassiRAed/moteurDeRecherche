A diving bell was an early system for underwater diving The basic idea of a bell is that a hollow object even with an open bottom will hold air when put under water If the bell is heavy enough it will sink below the water A swimmer can be inside the bell and breath or hold his breath and swim outside the bell for a short time and come back to the bell to breath again The idea had been around for a long time but became useful in the s Scuba diving has mostly replaced diving bells although they are still used sometimes
