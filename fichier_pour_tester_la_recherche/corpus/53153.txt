 Ternary form is a musical form It is also called song form or minuet and trio These forms all have three distinct sections The three sections are written in shorthand as ABA The music in the A sections is the same or very nearly the same The music in the B section is different from the A sections The B section usually provides some sort of musical contrast to the A sections It may be composed in a different but related key for example The B section is often called the trio especially in minuet s scherzo scherzi march march es polonaise s etc The B section came to be called the trio because a Baroque composer consistently scored this section in his minuet s for three instruments
