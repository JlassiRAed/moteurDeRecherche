 Pulmonary edema Normally the lungs fill with air when a person breathing breathes in From the alveoli in the lungs oxygen goes into the blood The blood then carries oxygen to the entire body Every part of the body needs oxygen to survive When a person has fluid in their lungs there is not enough space left for air to get into the lungs The person will not be able to breathe in as much air This means not as much oxygen will get into the blood and the body will not get the oxygen it needs
