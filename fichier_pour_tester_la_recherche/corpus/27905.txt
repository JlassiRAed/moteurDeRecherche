 multiple image Bioluminescence is the capacity of living things to produce light Often this is done by symbiosis In this the larger organism contains often in a special organ organ microorganism s which make the light Eukaryote protist s have special organelle s and some bacteria also produce light Bioluminescence is the result of chemical processes where the energy produced is released as visible light Bioluminescence has appeared many times during evolution ATP compound The role of Gamma Proteo bacteria in producing light is discussed in detail in reference works The capacity to produce light is an extension of normal metabolism all chemical reaction s produce a few photon s Visible light is produced when the photon production increases In the case of bacteria the original function of the reaction was probably to detoxify excessive oxygen
