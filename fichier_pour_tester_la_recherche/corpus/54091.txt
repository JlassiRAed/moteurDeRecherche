A computer algebra system mathematical equation s and expressions containing number s and symbols called variable s Variables can stand for known or unknown values that can be solved for or can be replaced with any value It always keeps the formula exactly the same mathematically as the original equation or expression unless it is being transformed by a transformation algorithm A CAS might be used for integral integration or derivative optimizing and finding the minimum and maximum values of results or variables etc Most have the ability to Cartesian coordinate system plot functions and expressions for visualization which can be helpful and educational too
