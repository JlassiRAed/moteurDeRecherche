The Golgi complex also known as the Golgi apparatus or simply the Golgi is a cytoplasm ic organelle It is found in eukaryote Cell cells as in animals plants and fungus fungi The complex was discovered by Camillo Golgi in Golgi was ignored and his discovery was said to be dirt on his lenses Years later electron microscope pictures showed structures just like in the original Golgi drawings It is made of several flattened sac like membranes which look like a stack of pancakes The main function of the Golgi apparatus is to process and package macromolecule s such as protein s and lipid s They come to the Golgi after being built and before they go to their destination The Golgi complex inspects them for flaws and discards extra material added during their manufacture wraps them up and then targets them for packaging The Golgi complex is especially active in processing proteins for secretion The Golgi releases special enzymes called lysosome s which clean off any extra amino acids When the package is ready it is pinched off the Golgi and released into the cytoplasm The Golgi complex is part of the cellular membrane system and so is the endoplasmic reticulum It has two faces called the maturation face and formation face
