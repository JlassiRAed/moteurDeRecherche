 Electrical resistivity is a concept in electrical engineering It is a measure of how much an electrical conductor stops the flow of electricity through it Most metals have a very low electrical resistivity The SI uses the ohm metre for measuring how much electrical resistivity there is Electrical resistivity is also inverse of electrical conductivity This term is more meaningful in case of semiconductors and insulators
