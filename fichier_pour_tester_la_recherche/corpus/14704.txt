An asylum seeker is a person who was forced to flee from their country due to democide genocide or mass murder and routed to nearby countries to seek refuge but is not accepted yet as a refugee Refugees and asylum seekers are different The decision whether a person is a refugee or not is most often left to certain government agencies with the host country This can lead to a situation where the country will see an asylum seeker neither as refugee nor as legitimate migrant Then they will be treated as an Alien even if their life was endangered in the country they fled from If a person comes to a country to seek asylum their refugee status will then be assessed The government decides whether the person is in danger because of persecution or if they are just trying to come to that country for free If a person is not a refugee they will not have the rights of a refugee In that case the government does not have to follow the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees
