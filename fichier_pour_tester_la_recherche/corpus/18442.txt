 Habituation is a basic activity whereby an animal wikt response responds less to repeated Stimulus stimuli It is a primitive kind of learning The learning that underlies habituation is a basic process of biological systems Animals do not need conscious wikt motivation motivation or wikt awareness awareness for it to occur Habituation enables organisms to distinguish meaningful information from background stimuli Habituation occurs in all animals as well as in the large protozoan Stentor coeruleus Two factors that can influence habituation include the time between each stimulus and the length of time the stimulus is presented Shorter intervals and longer durations increase habituation and vice versa
