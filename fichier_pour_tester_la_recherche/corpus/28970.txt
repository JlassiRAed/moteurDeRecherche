 The Weddell seal is a Earless seal seal that is common in Antarctica It is named after James Weddell who discovered it Estimations are that there are half a million to a million of these animals left which makes it the most common seal in Antarctica after the Crabeater seal During the winter most Weddel seals do not migrate northwards Instead they keep open a hole in the ice by gnawing it with their teeth
