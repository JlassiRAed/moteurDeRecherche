 Ribonuclease is a type of enzyme that chops RNA into smaller parts There are many different versions of the enzyme All organisms studied contain many RNases of many different sorts This shows that RNA degradation is a very ancient and important process It cleans up cell RNA which is no longer needed It is a first line defence against RNA virus es It acts in RNA interference This is a biological process in which RNA molecules inhibit gene expression In Andrew Fire and Craig Mello shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their work on RNA interference
