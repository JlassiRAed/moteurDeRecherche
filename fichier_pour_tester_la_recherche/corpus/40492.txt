In organic chemistry an epoxide is a molecule that has a ring with at least three atoms in total two carbon atoms and one oxygen atom These three atoms are chemical bond bonded or stuck together in a small ring The ring of atoms is shaped like a triangle with all edges of the same length Because of this small ring an epoxide is very reactive Epoxides can be made by oxidation of alkene s There are many ways to do this Usually a peroxide is used Some ways can even make only one enantiomer of the epoxide Epoxides like to react with nucleophile s Usually when an epoxide reacts with a nucleophile the first thing it does is break one of its chemical bond s between the oxygen atom and the carbon atom This makes the triangular ring pop open With the ring open the nucleophile gets stuck onto one of the carbon atoms On the other carbon the left over oxygen attaches to a hydrogen atom turning into an alcohol This is very useful because it is easy to change an alcohol into many other functional group s Epoxides are useful because with them very complicated molecules can be made quickly Epoxides are extremely useful for making many other compounds That is because oxygen which is in an epoxide is such a great functional group Once you have made an epoxide you can make alcohols ethers and halohydrins among other things chem stub
