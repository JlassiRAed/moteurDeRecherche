 Specific Gravity is a special case of relative density It is defined as the ratio of the density of a given substance to the density of water Substances with a specific gravity greater than are heavier than water and those with a specific gravity of less than are lighter than water SG is by definition dimensionless and therefore not dependent on the system of units used insofar as the units are consistent Based on the SG value of a given substance the density of that substance can be calculated
