A battering ram is a siege engine used in the past It was used to break open the stone walls of castle s or splinter their wooden gates In its simplest form a battering ram is just a large heavy log carried by several people and banged against an obstacle The ram damages the target if the big log hit the target again and again Later rams were covered in the log with an arrow proof fire resistant canopy mounted on wheels Inside the canopy the log was swung from chains or ropes Rams were great weapons of war against old fashioned wall building materials such as stone and brick These walls were weak in Tension tension they cracked when struck with sufficient force With many blows the cracks would grow steadily until a hole was created Eventually a breach would appear in the fabric of the wall It would cause armed attackers to force their way through the gap The introduction in the later Middle Ages of siege cannon s causes the end of battering rams and other traditional siege weapons Much smaller hand held versions of battering rams are still used today however by law enforcement officers and military personnel to bash open locked doors
