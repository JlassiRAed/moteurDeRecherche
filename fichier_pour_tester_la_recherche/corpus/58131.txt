 Billboard Billboard magazine indexes the artists on their website by a number called the artist ID Each individual artist has a single identification number through which all chart history can be tracked form inside and outside the website This template is used to support Internally it uses forty subtemplates split by the first character of the artist s name This prevents the system from needing to load the entire translation table every time the system compiles the artists and their respective IDs and provides the ID when called with a supported artist s name It is a reasonably complete list and anyone can help adding or asking missing IDs to it This template is a supporting template of the time the artists name can be passed to urlencode and the link will be fine The other are a real problem Billboard replaces most but not all characters that are not in the English alphabet with a Sometimes Billboard will replace characters that are not in the English alphabet with a replacement that they think looks appropriate Billboard frequently but not always drops a the of as and in from the URLs characters frequently mangle the characters around it The rules are psychotically inconsistent For example Mike the Mechanics becomes but Florence The Machine becomes This template is simply an override It returns the results of urlencode if it will work Exception cases are listed and a specific string is returned
