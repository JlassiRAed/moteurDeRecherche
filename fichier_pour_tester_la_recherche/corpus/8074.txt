 Keynesian economics describes the economics theories of John Maynard Keynes Keynes wrote about his theories in his book The General Theory of Employment Interest and Money The book was published in Keynes said capitalism was a good economic system In a capitalist system people earn money from their work Businesses employ and pay people to work Then people can spend their money on things they want Other people work and make things to buy Sometimes the capitalist system has problems People lose their work Businesses close People cannot work and cannot spend money Keynes said the government should step in and help people who do not have work This idea is called demand side policy If people are working the economy is good If people are not working the economy is bad Keynes said when the economy is bad people want to save their money That is they do not spend their money on things they want As a result there is less economic activity Keynes said the government should spend more money when people do not have work The government can borrow money and give people jobs Then people can spend money again and buy things This helps other people find work Some people such as conservatism conservatives libertarianism libertarians and people who believe in Austrian economics do not agree with Keynes ideas They say government work does not help capitalism They say when the government borrows money it takes money away from businesses They do not like Keynesian economics because they say the economy can get better without government help During the late s Keynesian economics became less popular because inflation was high at the same time that unemployment was high This is because many people interpreted Keynesian theory to say that it was impossible for there to be both high inflation and high unemployment When a big recession happened in Keynesian economics became more popular Leaders around the world created stimulus packages which would allow their government to spend a lot of money to create jobs
