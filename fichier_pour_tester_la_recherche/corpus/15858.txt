 In Selinker showed the concept of Interlanguage fossilization Interlangauge means a language learning stage before achieving the new language Sometimes it is defined as an imperfect language Fossilization means a condition where nothing can be changed So interlanguage fossilization means the second language learners failure for achieving the new language Thus the learners language ability cannot be improved in the interlanguage fossilization There are two reasons why the interlanguage fossilization happens Interlanguage fossilization occurs in adults learning a new language In language learning unlike the child adults can t ignore about language rules and grammar When adults study a new language they always check the language rules or grammar This can make learning a language much harder In addition adults are more likely to be influence influenced by their native language In other words the native language interferences hold adults back from improving language proficiency Therefore there are many adults language learners who experience the interlanguage fossilization Acceptance of a new culture can also cause interlanguage fossilization If the learners are in new country then they have to learn a new language When the learners are in new cultures they try to make it suitable themselves to new circumstances At first they feel nervous because there are big cultural differences Therefore the learners study hard However after time goes by people stop studying a new language because they cannot feel nervous anymore The learner think that they are fully adapted in the new culture and they are confident with their new language proficiency Then interlanguage fossilization happens
