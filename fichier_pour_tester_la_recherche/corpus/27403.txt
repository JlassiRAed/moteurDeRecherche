In thermodynamics the internal energy of a thermodynamic system or a physical body body with well defined dimension boundaries denoted by U or sometimes E is the total of the kinetic energy due to the motion of molecule s and the potential energy associated with the vibrational and electricity electric energy of atom s within molecules or crystal s It includes the energy in all the chemical bond s and the energy of the free electrical conduction conduction electron s in metal s The internal energy is a thermodynamic potential and for a closed system closed thermodynamic thermodynamic system system held at constant entropy it will be Principle of minimum energy minimized One can also calculate the internal energy of electromagnetic radiation electromagnetic or black body blackbody radiation It is a state function of a system an extensive quantity The SI unit of energy is the joule although other historical conventional units are still in use such as the
