Don t stuff beans up your nose is a metaphor for not telling people to not do something This is because telling people not to do something makes them want to do it more Don t give them ideas It comes from a story about a mother who was leaving her son at home for the afternoon He was a troublemaker so she gave him a long list of things not to do Don t play with the oven Don t break anything Don t let any strangers in the house Don t try to start your father s car And don t stuff beans up your nose This gave him the idea to stuff beans up his nose and that is exactly what he did
