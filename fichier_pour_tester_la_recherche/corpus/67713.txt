An alkyne is a molecule that has a triple bond between two carbon atoms They have general formula C They are also called acetylenes The smallest alkyne is acetylene also called ethyne Alkynes are hydrophobic this means they dissolve well in organic solvent s but not in water Alkynes are more reactive than usual hydrocarbon s For example they are more reactive than alkene s in many reactions If the alkyne is at the end of a molecule it is easy to remove the proton with a strong base base Then the alkyne can be used in addition reaction s For example it can be added to a ketone Alkynes are also easy to redox reduce to double bond s They can be made into both trans and cis double bonds Alkynes are also used a lot in pericyclic reaction s
