 Seismic performance analysis or seismic analysis is an intellectual tool of earthquake engineering which breaks the complex topic into smaller parts to gain a better understanding of seismic performance of building and non building structures or their building model models In general seismic analysis is based on the methods of structural dynamics However those response spectra are good mostly for single degree of freedom systems Numerical step by step integration seems to be a more effective method of analysis for multi degree of freedom structural systems at severe process of earthquake earthquake excitation The design of structures rests on authorized engineering procedures principle s and criteria meant to design or seismic retrofit retrofit structures subject to earthquake exposure The price of poor seismic analysis may be enormous Nevertheless seismic analysis has always been a trial and error process no matter it was based upon physical law s or wikt empirical empirical knowledge
