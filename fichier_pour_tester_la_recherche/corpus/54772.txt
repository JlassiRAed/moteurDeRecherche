The TERGV is a model to run train s in Nord Pas de Calais The idea is to run regional trains on lines constructed for express trains instead of the classic lines This works only in the case that the high speed line is used only rarely Running regional trains on such lines slows down the express trains and costs more than running them on the classic lines Despite these problems the concept is very promising for distances between and km There are currently two lines that operate in this manner Lille Dunkerque Lille Calais Boulogne sur Mer To use these connections an extra fee must be paid which is three euro s per day Another line Lille to Arras has been opened This line does not require the extra fee and has proved very successful
