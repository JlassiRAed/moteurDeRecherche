 Priming is an implicit memory effect in which exposure to one stimulus influences the response to another stimulus In experiments the same target stimuli can be presented with different primes This allows the priming effect to be measured Priming can occur following wikt Perceptual perceptual semantic or wikt conceptual conceptual stimulus repetition For example if a person reads a list of words including the word table and is later asked to complete a word starting with tab the probability that he or she will answer table is greater than if they are not primed Another example is if people see an incomplete sketch they are unable to identify and they are shown more of the sketch until they recognize the picture later they will identify the sketch at an earlier stage than was possible for them the first time Priming effects are independent of simple recognition memory Priming works best when the two stimuli are in the same modality modality For example visual priming works best with visual cues and verbal priming works best with verbal cues But priming also occurs between modalities Several researchers for example have used cross modal priming to investigate Syntax syntactic deficits in individuals with damage to Broca s area of the brain See the following Swinney D E Zurif P Prather and T Love The neurological distribution of processing operations underlying language comprehension Manuscript Department of Psychology University of California San Diego For an overview see also Zurif E B Brain regions of relevance to syntactic rocessing in Knowledge of meaning an introduction to semantic theory eds Richard Larson and Gabriel Segal MIT Press
