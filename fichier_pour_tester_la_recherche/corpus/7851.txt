 Cytochromes are haemoprotein s They make Adenosine triphosphate ATP by electron transport They are found either as single or as part of bigger enzyme complexes which catalysis catalyze redox reactions The haem group does the redox reactions These include all chemical reactions in which atoms have their oxidation state changed In general redox reactions involve the transfer of electrons
