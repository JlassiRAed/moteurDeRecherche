A gyre is a large system of ocean current s moving in a circle Gyres are caused by the Coriolis effect Because the Earth is Rotation rotating ocean currents in the northern hemisphere tend to move in a clockwise direction and currents in the southern hemisphere in an anti clockwise direction The Earth rotates from the west towards the east and the Coriolis effect becomes more intense toward the Geographical pole poles Because of this gyres form strong currents on the western side of oceans so they are pushed against the eastern coast of continents The term gyre can be used to mean any type of vortex in the air or the sea but it is most used in oceanography for the major ocean current systems
