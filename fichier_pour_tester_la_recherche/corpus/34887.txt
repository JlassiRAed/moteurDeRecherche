 The moment of Force about any point is the product of the force and perpendicular distance between them If this first moment is again multiplied by the perpendicular distance between them the product so obtained is called the second moment of force or moment of moment of the force If instead of force the area of the figure or mass of the body is considered it is called the second moment of area or second moment of mass They are also termed broadly as moments of inerta There is no physical significance for moment of inertia It is just a mathematical expression usually denoted by
