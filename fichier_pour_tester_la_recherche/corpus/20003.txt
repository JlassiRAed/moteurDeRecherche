When file system s store a file they usually try to store the whole file in one part When the disk drive fills up finding an empty space that is large enough becomes more difficult In such a case the file systems will split the file into parts and store each part at a different location on the disk This process is known as Fragmentation fragmentation Fragmentation occurs because the different parts are not stored next to one another When the file is read it has to be assembled from the different locations Files that are stored in one part can be read faster Defragmentation is the process of rearranging the different parts so that they are stored next to each other This is usually done by copying them to a different place on the disk Defragmentation is relevant to file systems on electromechanical disk drives To read each part the head of the hard disk needs to reposition itself to the area where the part is stored The problem of defragmentation is that it is takes a long time and in some cases the file system cannot be changed while it is in progress For that reason defragmentation should not be done when it can be avoided There are different kinds of files some of them are modified more often It is often a good practice to put them on different partitions as most Unix like Unix like operating systems do Also the design of hard drives has changed over time which will make the effects of defragmentation less visible Media that use flash memory such as solid state disk solid state disks do not profit from defragmentation as there are no moving parts than need to be re positioned
