Stove fans are used to distribute the warm air generated by a wood burning stove to the surrounding area main types are available one uses the Seedbeck effect to generate a small electric current to drive a small electric fan The other type uses a simple Stirling type engine to provide the mechanical power to drive the fan They are usually located on the top surface of the stove and direct their air stream into the general area of the room For the electric type a thermoelectric power generator and it generates an electric currentthat is used to drive the motor The TEG uses a set of doped semiconductor elements to produce the current when a temperature difference exists between the hot and cold sides of the module This is then fed to the low torque fan motor It is important that a temperature difference exists across the TEG for it to work properly tooo low a difference results in minimal power output The cool side of the TEG is often arranged to be cooled by the fan usually utlising a heat sink to improve the cooling The Stirling type uses the expansion and contraction of a volume of air air to provide the mechanical drive via a crank with a piston driven up by air heated up by the stove and hence expanding and cooled when reaching the top of its stroke causing the air to contract This then drives the fan via the crank
