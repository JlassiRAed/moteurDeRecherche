A releaser is a stimulus from one animal to another which causes a particular wikt response response The releaser or sign stimulus triggers an innate releasing mechanism in the receiver The receiver then does its response the fixed action pattern This kind of system is heritable inherited by both animals Example a fledgling bird does its releaser say it squawks and opens its beak wide showing bright red inside throat This triggers the adult to cough up food stored in its gullet Both partners are behaving instinct ually with inherited behaviours these are not learnt during life A FAP can truly be said to be hard wired a specific stimulus nearly always results in the same behavioral response Another behavious system is the dances of water birds such as the Great Crested Grebe They pair for life and dance whenever a pair meet up after an absence and on other occasions The dances are quite complex and were first described fully by Julian Huxley Here the meeting is the releaser and both partners do the fixed action pattern The function of the system is a little unclear but it has something to do with reinforcing the pair s bond It is not necessary for both partners to benefit nor to be of the same species Some moths instantly fold their wings and drop to the ground if they encounter bat ultrasonic signals This helps helps the moths but obviously not the bats In turn some bats turn of the sound blips when they hear a moth and glide in the last few feet This also is an inherited behaviour
