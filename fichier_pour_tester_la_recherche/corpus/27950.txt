 Data parallelism is a form of parallel computing for multiple Central processing unit processor s using a technique for distributing the data across different parallel processor nodes It contrasts to task parallelism as another form of parallelism In a Multiprocessing multiprocessor system where each one is executing a single set of instructions data parallelism is achieved when each processor performs the same task on different pieces of distributed data In some situations a single execution thread controls operations on all pieces of data In others different threads control the operation but they execute the same code For example if we are running code on a processor system in order to reduce the runtime of the execution Data parallelism is used by many applications especially data processing applications one of the examples is database applications Most real programs use a combination of data parallelism and task parallelism
