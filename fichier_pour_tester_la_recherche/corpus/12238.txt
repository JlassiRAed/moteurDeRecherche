 Modular arithmetic sometimes also called clock arithmetic is a way of doing arithmetic with integers Much like hours on a clock which repeat every twelve hours once the numbers reach a certain value called the modulus they go back to zero People talked about modular arithmetic in many ancient cultures For instance the Chinese remainder theorem is many centuries old The modern notation and exact definition of modular arithmetic were first described by Carl Friedrich Gauss
