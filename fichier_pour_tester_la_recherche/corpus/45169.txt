A pinhole camera is a camera without a conventional glass photographic lens lens An extremely small hole in a thin material can create an image when all light rays from a scene go through a single point In order to produce a reasonably clear image the aperture has to be about th the distance to the screen or less The shutter of a pinhole camera usually consists of a hand operated flap of some light proof material to cover and uncover the pinhole A common use of a pinhole camera is to capture the movement of sunlight over a long period of time This type of photography is called Solargraphy Pinhole cameras require much longer exposure times than conventional cameras because of the small aperture typical exposure times can range from seconds to hours or days The image may be projected on a translucent screen for real time viewing
