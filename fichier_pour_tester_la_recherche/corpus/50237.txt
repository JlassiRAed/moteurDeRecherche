In physics a gravitational field is a scientific model model used to explain the influence that a massive body has The influence extends into the space around itself producing a force on another massive body Thus a gravitational field is used to explain gravitation al phenomena In the original Newtonian concept gravity was a force between point mass es Following Isaac Newton Newton Laplace attempted to model gravity as some kind of radiation field or fluid Since the th century explanations for gravity have in terms of a Field field model rather than a point attraction This revolution was brought about by Einstein s general theory of relativity Most scientists believe that the gravitational field and its gravitational wave s are the physical interpretations of Einstein s equations of general relativity In a field model rather than two particles attracting each other the mass of objects distort spacetime This distortion is what is perceived and measured as a force In such a model matter moves in certain ways in response to the curvature of spacetime cite book title General relativity from A to B last Geroch Robert publisher University of Chicago Press isbn
