The Eastern Front of World War I was the theatre in which Germany and Austria Hungary fought Russia This front had more troops than the Western Front Western Front but was at least three and up to five times longer than it meaning that planning where to concentrate your forces was very important because you could only transfer and reinforce your forces very slowly compared to on the Western Front Russia lost a lot of battles but her overall situation improved as she improved her forces and more and more allies entered the war on her side The Eastern Front ended when the Russian Civil War broke out between the Communists and Russian Social Democratic Party in and the Communists signed a peace treaty with Germany so they could focus on winning the Civil War
