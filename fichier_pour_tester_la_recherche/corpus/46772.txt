An ice sheet is a large mass of glacier ice that covers an area of more than There are two ice sheets in the world at the moment in Antarctica and Greenland Ice sheets are larger than ice shelf ice shelves or alpine glacier s Masses of ice covering less than km are called ice cap s The ice in an ice cap usually comes from a series of glaciers that drain into it The Antarctic ice sheet is the largest single mass of ice on Earth It covers an area of almost million km The ice sheet first formed in the early Oligocene It retreated and advanced many times until the Pliocene when it came to occupy almost all of Antarctica The Greenland ice sheet covers about of the surface of Greenland Satellite image s from NASA show that it is melting at a rate of about cubic kilometres The ice sheet did not develop at all until the late Pliocene but apparently developed very quickly This had the unusual effect of allowing fossil s of plant s that once grew on present day Greenland to be much better preserved than with the slowly forming Antarctic ice sheet
