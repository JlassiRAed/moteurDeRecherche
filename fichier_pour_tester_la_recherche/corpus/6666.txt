 Khmer is the official language of Cambodia Kampuchea Cambodia Its Khmer script script was the base for the Thai script although Thai does not use subscript consonants One thing that makes it particularly difficult for many foreigners to learn is that Khmer words are not separated in a sentence and the sounds are quite hard for foreigners to replicate But still each word in the sentence can be distinguished Also there is not much material on Khmer although this situation is changing
