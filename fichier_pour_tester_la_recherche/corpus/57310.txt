A instruction pipelining is a technique used in the design of modern microprocessor s microcontroller s and Central processing unit CPUs to increase their Instruction The main idea is to divide with storage at the end of each step This allows the Central processing unit CPUs control logic to handle instructions at the processing rate of the slowest step which is much faster than the time needed to process the instruction as a single step The term pipeline refers to the fact that each step is carrying a single microinstruction Most modern Central processing unit CPUs are driven by a clock The CPU consists internally of logic and memory is reduced In this way the clock period can be reduced For example the RISC pipeline is broken into five stages with a set of flip flops between each stage as follow Instruction fetch Instruction decode and register fetch Execute Memory access Register write backProcessors with pipelining consist internally of stages so that the stage s output is an input to another stage until the job of processing instructions is done Such organization of processor internal modules reduces the instruction s overall processing time A non pipeline architecture is not as Efficiency efficient because some CPU modules are idle while another module is active during the instruction cycle Pipelining does not completely remove idle time in a pipelined CPU but making CPU modules work in parallel increases instruction throughput An instruction pipeline is said to be fully pipelined if it can accept a new instruction every clock cycle A pipeline that is not fully pipelined has wait cycles that delay the progress of the pipeline
