In computer engineering an execution unit is a part of a central processing unit CPU that performs specific operations or calculations It may have its own internal control sequence unit some processor register register s and other internal units such as a sub arithmetic logic unit ALU or floating point unit FPU or some smaller more specific components Now modern CPUs have multiple parallel execution units referred to as scalar or superscalar design The simplest arrangement is to use one the bus manager to manage the memory interface and the others to perform calculations Additionally modern CPUs execution units are usually instruction pipelining pipelined
