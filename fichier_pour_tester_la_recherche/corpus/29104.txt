 Precipitation is a form of water from the atmosphere It is a term in meteorology and includes rain snow sleet dew frost and hail These form from atmospheric water vapour and fall under gravity Fog and mist are not precipitation but suspensions In that case the water vapour does not condense sufficiently to precipitate If liquid precipitation can be measured using a rain gauge The most common form of solid precipitation is snow Snow is made when temperatures are so cold that water vapor changes directly to solid crystals Frozen rain is hail or sleet
