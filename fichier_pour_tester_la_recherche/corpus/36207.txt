A personal union is a relationship of two or more sovereign state s which through law share the same person as their head of state Personal unions can begin for very different reasons The case that a princess who is already married to a king becomes pregnant and their child inherits the crown of both countries is a rather common cause But a personal union sometimes was seen as a means against uprisings if a state wants an annexation of an other state These unions can be written down in a constitution that clearly expresses that both states shall share the same person as head of state but that is not always the case Under these circumstances a personal union can easily be broken
