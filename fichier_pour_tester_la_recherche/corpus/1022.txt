 Waste heat is the by product heat of machine s and technical wikt process processes for which no useful application is found A fraction of input energy is always Energy conversion converted to heat by friction between machine parts and other processes such as liquid friction Mechanical drives can be designed to run smoothly with little loss of energy to heat Machines for energy conversion conversion of energy contained in fuels to mechanical work or electric energy produce large amounts of waste heat This waste heat can be re used if a cogeneration system is used It is hard to use waste heat because it is difficult to transport the heat to another place and it is difficult to store the heat for use at another time In electrification of waste heat organic matter can be used as a working medium to produce electricity on much lower temperatures compared to the water steam cycle
