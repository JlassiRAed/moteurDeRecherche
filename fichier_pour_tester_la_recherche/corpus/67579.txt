In organic chemistry an elimination reaction is when some atom s or group of atoms are taken away from a bigger molecule Usually a double bond double or a triple bond triple bond are made by this reaction There are two main ways to do an elimination reaction The first is called E It happens in two steps If there is a good leaving group in the molecule it can leave on its own Then a base or another substance can take away the other group The second way is called E This happens only in one step In this case the base takes away one group while at the same time the leaving group goes away A common elimination reaction happens with alcohol s If there is strong acid around a molecule of water can be eliminated to form the double bond
