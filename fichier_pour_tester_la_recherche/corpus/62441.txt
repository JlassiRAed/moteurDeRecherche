In mathematics a relation is used to describe certain properties of things That way certain things may be connected in some way this is called a relation It is clear that things are either related or they are not there is no in between Relations are classified into four types based on mapping of elements Formally a relation is a set of n tuples of equal degree Thus a binary relation is a set of pairs a ternary relation a set of triples and so forth In the language of set theory a relation between two sets is a subset of their Cartesian product The use of the term relation is often used as shorthand to refer to binary relations where the set of all the starting points is called the domain and the set of the ending points is the range The domain is the x s and the range is the y s
