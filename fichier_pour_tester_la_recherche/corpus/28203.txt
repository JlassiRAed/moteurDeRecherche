The subset sum problem is an important problem of computer science It can be stated as follows Given a set of integer s does any subset of them sum to zero For example given the set the answer is yes because the subset sums to zero The problem is NP Complete It can be reformulated to the Boolean satisfiability problem SAT An alternative statement of this problem is given a set of numbers and an integer x determine whether or not there exist a subset that sums up to x Eg given a set and x the answer is yes because sums to Remember that the subsequence need not to be contiguous For instance if x in above example the answer is still yes because sums to
