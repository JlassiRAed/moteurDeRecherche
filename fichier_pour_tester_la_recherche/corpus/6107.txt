 Optics is the science of light and how it interacts with the world Optics explains how rainbow s exist how light reflects off mirror s how light refraction refracts through glass or water and what splits light shining through a prism In addition to visible light in the standard spectrum of red orange yellow green blue indigo and violet optics also deals with invisible parts of the whole electromagnetic spectrum of which visible light is but a small part Optics is both a science and an area of engineering It has been used to make many useful things including eyeglasses camera s telescope s and microscope s Many of these things are based on Lens lenses which focusing focus light and can make image s of things that are bigger or smaller than the original While optics is an old science new things are still being discovered in it Scientists have learned how to make light travel through a thin optical fiber made of glass or plastic Light can go long distances in a fiber Fibers are used to carry phone calls and the Internet between cities
