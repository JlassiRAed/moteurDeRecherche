The category is for articles and events specifically related to the decade of the s which begins in the year and ends in the year Because nothing is zeroth in the numerical order there is no year zero in either the Gregorian calendar or the Julian calendar The first decade of the Common era runs from the beginning of the year AD through the end of the year AD while the decade before it starts at the beginning of the year BC and ends at the end of the year BC The years BC and AD are consecutive and so are the st century BC and the st century AD Note that the term the year means the st year because the English uses cardinal numbers for years instead of the more complicated ordinal numbers This usage may not be relevant when the number of the year is small but does come into prominence with three or four digit numbers
