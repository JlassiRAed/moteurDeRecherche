An electron configuration is the arrangement of electron s within an atom The electron configuration describes where the electrons are inside atomic orbital orbitals The structure of the Periodic table Periodic table of elements is partly based on electron configuration There are four kinds of electron configurations s p d and f orbitals S orbitals are roughly sphere shaped p orbitals are shaped like a dumbbell d orbitals are usually shaped like a four leaf clover and f orbitals form a mathematically complex shape An atom can have more than one orbital in fact all except hydrogen do Similarly atoms can have more than one of each kind of orbital The electron configurations fill up with electrons in an unchanging order
