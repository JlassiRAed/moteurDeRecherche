The resting potential of a cell is the membrane potential that would be maintained if there were no action potential s Inhibitory Post Synaptic Current synaptic potential s or other active changes in the membrane potential In most cells the resting potential has a negative value which by convention means that there is excess negative charge inside compared to outside The resting potential is mostly determined by the concentrations of the ion s in the fluids on both sides of the cell membrane and the membrane transport ion transport protein s that are in the cell membrane How the concentrations of ions and the membrane transport proteins influence the value of the resting potential is outlined below
