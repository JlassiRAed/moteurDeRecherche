The AVR microcontroller architecture was developed by Atmel in It is based on the Harvard microcontroller architecture The AVR was one of the first microcontroller families to use on chip flash memory for program storage as opposed to one time programmable ROM EPROM or EEPROM used by other microcontrollers at the time Many people think that AVR stands for A lf s R isc processor This architecture replaces older MCS architecture One machine cycle of MCS takes clock cycles and most of instructions are executed in one machine cycle AVR microcontrollers can execute most of instructions in single machine cycle too but one machine cycle takes only one clock cycle Performance per clock cycle is times higher with AVR The core has general purpose registers directly connected to ALU It allowing two independentregisters to be accessed and instruction with them executed in one machine cycle
