 photo color artificially added Ice algae and snow algae are algae and cyanobacteria which grow on long lasting snow and ice fields like glaciers When liquid water is available between the snow and ice crystals they may color the surface green yellow or red during the summer months The red pigment of some species is an intracellular protection against excessive visual light and ultraviolet radiation of the sun which otherwise can cause photoinhibition of photosynthesis or mutation s Without it the algae at the surface would suffer chromosome breaks and DNA mutations There are also ice algal communities on sea ice These algae because they provide food for krill Krill scrape off the algae from the underside of the ice which is colored brown by the algae The algae may be found between ice crystal s or attached to them in the water or brine saltwater channels between ice crystals
