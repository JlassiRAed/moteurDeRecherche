 Cone cells or simply cones are special photoreceptor cell s in the retina They react to light and work best in relatively bright light Cone cells are less sensitive to light than rod cell s Rod cells are more sensitive to light but cannot tell colors apart Human eye s usually have different types of cone cells That way cones allow the brain color vision to tell colors apart Their reaction to stimulus stimuli is faster than that of the rod cells For this reason they can perceive finer details and more rapid changes in images Humans usually have three kinds of cones with different photopsin s Each photopsin has different response curves to light and so responds to color in different ways This gives trichromatic vision Being color blindness color blind means a lack of one or two types of cone In a publication done in Osterberg thinks that there are about million cone cells in a human eye
