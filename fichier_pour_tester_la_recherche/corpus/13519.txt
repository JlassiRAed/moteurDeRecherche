In chemistry an enantiomer is a molecule that looks exactly like another one when viewed in a mirror The subject of mirror image chemicals is known as chirality If you try to put the two molecules on top of each other they will not be the same This is because they have one chirality chiral centre It is important that they only have one otherwise the two molecules are called diastereoisomer s Both enantiomers of a molecule have the same basic properties For example they have the same boiling point and NMR spectroscopy NMR spectrum Therefore they are difficult to separate It is sometimes very important to separate them because in some drug molecules one enantiomer might have the right effect but the other might be dangerous One famous example is thalidomide one enantiomer of the molecule causes birth defects
