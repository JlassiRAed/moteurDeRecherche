 Hydroelectricity is electricity that is made by the movement of water water It is usually made with dam s that block a river to make a reservoir or collect water that is pumped there When the water is let go the huge pressure behind the dam forces the water down pipe s that lead to a turbine This causes the turbine to turn which turns a generator which makes electricity This use of renewable energy produces less pollution than steam engine s do Some places such as Norway and Quebec get most of their electricity this way
