 Voltage is a force that makes electricity move through a wire It is measured in volt s Voltage is also called electric tension or electromotive force It was named after Alessandro Volta Technically the voltage is the difference in electric potential between two points Voltage is always measured between two points for example between the positive and negative ends of a battery or between a wire and ground As seen in volt Hydraulic analogy voltage can be seen as the pressure on the electrons to move out of the source It is directly proportional to the pressure exerted on the electrons In other words the higher the voltage the higher the pressure For example a battery of volts will exert pressure on the electrons twice as hard as a battery of volts The voltage can push the electrons into a component like a resistor creating a Electric current current Usually the voltage and the current are related by a formula Note that there must be both voltage and current to transfer power For example a wire can have a high voltage on it but unless it is connected nothing will happen Birds can land on high voltage lines such as kV and kV without dying because the current does not flow through the bird There are two types of voltage direct current DC voltage and Alternating current AC voltage The DC voltage The DC is typically used for electronics and the AC for motors
