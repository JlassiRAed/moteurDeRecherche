 Seed dispersal is the way seed s get from the parent plant to a new place Dispersal means to spread or scatter The basic idea is as follows Plants obviously cannot move after they have put down roots It follows that it is an evolution ary advantage to get their seeds away from the parent plant If the seeds take root nearby they will compete with each other and the parent plant Also a species is more likely to survive when its members are widely spread This is because local disasters still leave plants in other places From the first land plants in the Silurian period for million years to the Lower Cretaceous virtually all transport of spores and seeds was done by mechanical means In fact for most types of plants both fertilisation and dispersal was done by wind If not wind then water was the medium A great change took place with the appearance of flowering plants in the Cretaceous The story of flowers and insects is one of the best examples of co evolution The gut contents wing structures and mouthparts of fossilized Coleoptera beetles and Diptera flies suggest that they acted as early Pollination pollinators The association between Coleoptera beetles and angiosperm s during the Lower Cretaceous period led to parallel Adaptive radiation radiations of angiosperms and insects in the Upper Cretaceous The evolution of nectary nectaries in Upper Cretaceous flowers signals the beginning of the mutualism between hymenoptera ns and angiosperms What is true of fertilisation is also true of dispersal Spores the tiny products of lower plants are almost always dispersed by wind So are many seeds Some seeds and their later development fruits are obviously adaptations to a world full of animals If they are dispersed by being eaten it is advantageous for them to be nutritious and good to eat So spores seeds and fruits may get dispersed mechanicallly or by animals wikt machine Mechanical means Spores and seeds dispersed by wind are wikt light light and get blown easily An extra step is when the spores or seeds are blown out forcibly Spores and seeds may be fired out by force in some cases Seeds and fruits dispersed by water can wikt float float Zoological means Many fruit s are eaten by animal s and the seeds are dropped after the fruit is Digestion digested Some fruits are carried on the fur of mammals
