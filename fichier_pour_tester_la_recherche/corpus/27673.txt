 Tritylodonts They were the last family of the non mammalian synapsid s One of the last cynodont lines to appear the Family which gave them their name The tritylodonts were herbivorous chewing through vegetation such as Plant stem stem s leaves and root s Tritylodonts have no canine teeth just incisor s and cheek teeth The jaw worked by grinding forward and backwards shredding the food between the ridges of the teeth They were the longest surviving of all the non mammalian therapsid s They appeared in the latest Triassic period and persisted through the Jurassic until the middle of the Cretaceous Ruta M Botha Brink J Mitchell S A Benton M J The radiation of cynodonts and the ground plan of mammalian morphological diversity Proceedings of the Royal Society B Biological Sciences This shows that the tritylodonts were a successful group of therapsids even though they lived right beneath the ruling dinosaur s feet so to speak It is very clear that the tritylodonts were warm blooded The tritylodont fossils were found in the Americas South Africa and Eurasia They may have managed to live worldwide including Antarctica There are quite a few parallels between these tritylodonts they were in direct competition and eventually they out competed the earlier group and replaced it
