 Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry with a mass spectrometer as a method of separating and detecting the ions Many chemists use Argon as a carrier gas to make the plasma The machine sends the sample ions through a series of small cones The cones let the plasma ions slowly enter the vacuum chamber of the mass spectrometer In trace elemental analysis the method has advantages of high speed precision and sensitivity compared to Atomic absorption spectroscopy atomic absorption techniques Analysis of lower concentrations at the same time is more prone to disruption by trace contaminants in labware and reagents used Some analyte s can not work with ICP MS Verification of analysis results requires additional work The variety of applications exceeds that of ICP OES and includes isotopic speciation Because ICP MS can help make atom bombs ICP MS hardware is a subject for special export ing regulations
