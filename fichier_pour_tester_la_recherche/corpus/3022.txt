 Stigmata are marks on a person s body that are like the wound s Jesus got from being crucified They supposedly happen to other religious people like Saint Francis of Assisi as well as Jesus The marks include nail holes in the hands and feet as if the person had been crucified but without that having happened Those who believe say that actual nails were not used The holes just appear as a miracle Those who do not believe say it is not a miracle They have other ways to explain those stories
