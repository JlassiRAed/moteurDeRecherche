The Temple of Jupiter Capitolium or Temple of the Capitoline Triad was a temple in the Roman city of Pompeii in Italy At the beginning this temple was dedicated to Jupiter Jupiter alone it was built in the mid nd century BC at the same time as the temple of Apollo was being worked on this was the era at which Roman influence over Pompeii was at its height and so Roman Jupiter beat out the Greek Apollo as the town s highest god Jupiter was the ruler of the gods and the protector of Rome where his temple was the center of Roman Religion and of the cult of state As the most important god in Ancient Rome many temples were built to honor Jupiter or the entire Capitoline Triad in towns newly taken over by the Romans This was also true for Pompeii where the Temple of Jupiter that was already there was enlarged and made more Roman when the Romans took over Pompeii was taken over by the Romans beginning in BC It was still allowed to mostly run itself however until the Italic Revolt against Rome at the beginning of the st century BC The building style of the town was largely borrowed from the Greeks but Roman rule would soon lead to changes in this style As opposed to the previous Samnite rulers of Pompeii the Romans thought that the building style was very important in religious as well as everyday life Pompeii was changed into a much more public and open place Public buildings and spaces would eventually be able to be found all over the city The temple had been built in BC to be a very noticeable part of the forum and it became Pompeii s main temple after Rome took over The inside of the temple housed the main room of the temple which held the statues of Jupiter Juno and Minerva and which only the priests were allowed to enter In an earthquake shook the city of Pompeii destroying much of the Temple of Jupiter After this the much smaller Temple of Jupiter Meilichios became the main place of worship to Jupiter and his group of three The first Temple of Jupiter was still waiting to be fixed when Mount Vesuvius erupted in burying the town of Pompeii under lava and ash The hollow temple can still be seen in Pompeii today
