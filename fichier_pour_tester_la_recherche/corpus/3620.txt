see text The Paridae is a family They are passerine songbird s which are native to the northern hemisphere and Africa Most of them used to be classified in the genus Parus which has now been split up These birds are mainly small stocky woodland species with short stout Beak bills Some have crest s They range in length from to centimetres They are adaptable birds with a mixed diet including seed s and insect s Many species will live around human habitation and come readily to bird feeder s for nuts or seed and learn to take other foods In Britain Great Tit s and Blue Tit s learned to break through the foil caps sealing bottles of milk on doorsteps to get at the cream on top Of course the change in milk packaging has robbed them of this delicacy These are hole nesting birds typically using trees although some species build nests on the ground They lay anything from three to nineteen speckled white Egg eggs depending on species
