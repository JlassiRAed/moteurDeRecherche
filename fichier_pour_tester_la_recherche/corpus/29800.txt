A superscalar Central processing unit CPU architecture implements a form of parallel computing called instruction level parallelism Instruction level parallelism inside a single processor which allows faster CPU throughput at the same clock rate A superscalar processor executes more than one instruction during a clock cycle by simultaneously dispatching multiple instructions a bit shifter or a Multiplication ALU multiplier While most superscalar CPUs are also Instruction pipelining pipelined it possible to have a non pipelined superscalar CPU or a pipelined non superscalar CPU The superscalar technique is associated with several identifying characteristics of the CPU core Instructions are issued from a sequential instruction stream CPU hardware dynamically checks for data dependencies between instructions at run time Accepts multiple instructions per clock cycleEach instruction executed by a Scalar processor s manipulates one or two data items at a time while each instruction executed by a Vector processor operates simultaneously on many data items A superscalar processor is a mixture of the two Each instruction processes one data item There are multiple redundant functional units inside each CPU code so that multiple instructions manipulates separate data items concurrently In a superscalar CPU an instruction dispatcher reads instructions from memory and decides which ones can be run in parallel dispatching them on the multiple redundant functional units available inside the CPU Superscalar CPU design is concerned with improving accuracy of the instruction dispatcher and allowing it to keep the multiple functional units in use at all times As of all general purpose CPUs are superscalar a typical superscalar CPU may include up to ALUs FPUs and two SIMD units If the dispatcher failed to utilize all of the units at all times the performance of the CPU will suffer
