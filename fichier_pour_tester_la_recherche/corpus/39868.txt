A unitary authority is a type of local authority that is responsible for all local government functions within its area This is different from a system where local government functions are divided between different authorities Typically unitary authorities cover large town s or city cities which are large enough to be independent of county or regional administration Sometimes they consist of counties which have no lower level of administration
