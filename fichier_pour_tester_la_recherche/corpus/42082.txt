 Natural selection is a central concept of evolution It was an idea of Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace and is sometimes called the survival of the fittest Darwin Charles Natural selection is the process where organism s with favourable Trait traits are more likely to reproduce In doing so they pass on these traits to the next generation Over time this process allows organisms to adaptation adapt to their environment This is because the allele frequency frequency of gene s for favourable traits increases in the population Members of a species are not all alike partly because of differences in heredity This is true even with children of the same parents Some of these differences might make one organism better at surviving and reproducing than others in a particular habitat When this organism reproduction reproduces it passes along the genes which gave it the advantage to its children Some adaptation s are extremely long lasting useful in many habitats The Origin of birds Modern ideas evolution of wings in birds is an example Others are good only as long as the environment stays the same If the environment changes enough then another organism might do better
