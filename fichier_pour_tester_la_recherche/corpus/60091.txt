A haplogroup is a group of single chromosomes or single DNA strands which share a common ancestor They have the same mutation in all versions Haplogroups show deep ancestral origins dating back thousands of years The International Society of Genetic Genealogy see Haplogroup definition in DNA NEWBIE GLOSSARY In human genetics the haplogroups usually studied are Y chromosome haplogroups Both can be used to define genetic populations Y DNA is passed only from father to son while mtDNA is passed only from mother to children Neither recombination recombines and thus Y DNA and mtDNA change only by chance mutations with no intermixture between parents genetic material
