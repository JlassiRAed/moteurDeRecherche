 Liquid crystals are special substance s that are usually liquid but that show certain properties of a crystal solid crystal A liquid crystal may flow like a liquid but its molecules may be rotated in a crystal like way There are many different types of liquid crystal phases Different phases are different because their Optics optical properties are different Using a microscope and a polarization polarized light source different liquid crystal phases will have different texture s This is also shown in the image The contrasting areas in the texture each correspond to a domain where the LC molecules are rotated in a different direction Within a domain however the molecules are well ordered LC materials may not always be in an LC phase
