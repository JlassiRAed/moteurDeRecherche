 Cirrina Incirrina Octopods are the order order which contains the common octopus and some other types Fossila are rare but they do have a fossil record starting in the later Carboniferous Octopods are put into two suborders One the Incirrina is composed of the well known Octopus of rocky shore s and coral reefs and its relatives The other suborder the Cirrina contains octopods whose tentacles are linked by an umbrella like mantle so their activity is rather different from the common octopus
