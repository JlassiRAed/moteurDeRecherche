An approximant consonant is a consonant that sounds in some ways like a vowel For example lateral approximant s like the sound for l in the English word like the sound for r in the English word right and semivowels like the sound for y in yes and the sound for w in wet are all approximants These sounds are pronounced by bringing two parts of the mouth for example the tongue and the roof of the mouth close to each other However it is not close enough to cause the air to be blocked like in a fricative consonant Also the parts are not far apart enough to become a vowel
