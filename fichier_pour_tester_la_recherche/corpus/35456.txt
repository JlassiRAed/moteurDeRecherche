This essay WP Authors of Wikipedia describes how articles are made Some parts of Wikipedia have been copied from very old encyclopedias However for the majority of articles Wikipedia has become a vast potluck pot luck dinner Notes The articles are mostly a somewhat random collection of information that many people thought to be worthy of interest One of the most difficult aspects for many people to realize is that Wikipedia is basically invented out of thin air and people have retro forced some rules with little regard to actually working with other people For those reasons some Wikipedia articles may seem quite bizarre and several so called official guidelines are still demanding peculiar rules years later with some rules so wiki spastic they have never been considered in any other multi user site The problem is so severe that there is even a policy WP Ignore all rules because many rules might no longer reflect what normal people would willingly follow What seemed to be a reasonable format limitation years ago might no longer apply Also as more thousands of users have joined it has become increasingly difficult to check the quality of new articles and hence many partial stubs with misspelled words have been created
