 Ancient woodland is the term used in the United Kingdom for woodland which has existed continuously since or before in England and Wales Before those dates planting of new woodland was uncommon so a wood present in was likely to have developed naturally The analogous American term is old growth forest For many species of animal and plant ancient woodland sites provide the only habitat For many others conditions on these sites are much more suitable than those on other sites Ancient woodland in the UK like rainforest in the tropics is home to rare and threatened species more than any other UK habitat For these reasons ancient woodland is often described as an irreplaceable resource or critical natural capital Ancient woodland is formally defined on maps by Natural England and equivalent bodies Many ancient woodlands have legal protection but an ancient woodland is not automatically protected
