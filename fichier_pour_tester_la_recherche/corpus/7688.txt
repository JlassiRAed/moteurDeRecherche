A concentrate is a special form of a substance where one of the base components is mostly removed The most common case is the removal of the solvent from a solution Fruit juice concentrate will have most of the water removed The benefit of this is that the concentrate takes up less volume and weighs less than the original solution This can save transportation costs When needed the solvent can simply be added again
