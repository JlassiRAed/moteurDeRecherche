 Cooperative binding is when the number of small molecules binding to a macromolecule depends on the concentration of those small molecules around the macromolecule This is a type of molecular binding which is where molecule s attach to each other in a stable way without Radioactive decay decaying or breaking that Chemical bond bond rapidly
