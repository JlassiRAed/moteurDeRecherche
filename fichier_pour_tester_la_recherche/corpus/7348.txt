 Child labour means that child ren are forced to Labour work like adult s and take part in an economics economic activity According to the ILO International Labour Organization this is applied to people up to age fifteen or seventeen in case of dangerous work Even though only about a fourth of the ILO members have ratified the respective convention this age limit is generally accepted Child labour refers to the employment of children in any work that deprives children of their childhood interferes with their ability to attend regular school and that is mentally physically socially or morally dangerous and harmful Child labour is fundamentally different from casual work done by children like guarding other children or helping here and there Child labour is forbidden in most countries These days we see many minor boys and girls working in tea stalls restaurants hotels and other small shops Some work in huge factories like brick factories This is caused due to child labour and the main reason why child labour occurs is poverty There are two kinds of work that minor s can do Some work they do is acceptable as it is only light or easy to do Children can also do it while they are well integrated into the family This kind of work can be done in addition to an education the children are getting The other kind of work is difficult to do or it is physically exhausting It may be dangerous the children may be required to work for long hours and in humiliating clothing In general the second kind of work is usually labelled child labour Estimates are that up to million children are affected by child labour eight million of these are affected by one of the worst forms of child labour they are child soldier s they are forced into prostitution they are used for child pornography they are child slave s debt bondage or affected by human trafficking There are many prejudice s against child labor in the Western world Very often such cases are known through scandal s made by the mass media In that manner a working child is often seen as a slavery slave working in a sweat shop in a third world country producing textile s or as one of the street children in South America The reality is different though Such shops exist all over the world also in countries like the United States or Italy The fact that child labour is involved is often hidden More than three quarters of this work is done in the sector of agriculture or it has to do with activities done at home in the context of the family If child slaves exist they are only a minority This form of work done by children also existed before industrialisation and globalisation the two phenomena have made it more visible at best
