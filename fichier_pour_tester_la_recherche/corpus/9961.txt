A physical quantity is a quantity in physics that can be measured Or a physical quantity is a physical property that can be quantified Examples of physical quantities are mass amount of substance length time temperature electric current luminosity light intensity force velocity density and many others A physical quantity is always measured of natural non living objects The foundation of physics rests upon physical quantities in term of which the laws of physics are expressed Therefore these quantities have to be measured accurately Physical quantities are often divided into two categories base quantities and derived quantities Derived quantities are those quantities which are derived from other physical quantities Examples of derived quantities are force velocity acceleration etc
