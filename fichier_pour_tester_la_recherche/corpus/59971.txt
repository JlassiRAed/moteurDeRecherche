A chosen plaintext attack secret key Modern cryptography is implemented in software or hardware and is used for a diverse range of applications for many applications a chosen plaintext attack is often very feasible Chosen plaintext attacks become extremely important in the context of Public key cryptography public key cryptography where the encryption key is public and attackers can encrypt any plaintext they choose Any cipher that can prevent chosen plaintext attacks is then also guaranteed to be secure against known plaintext attack known plaintext and ciphertext only attacks this is a conservative approach to security Two forms of chosen plaintext attack can be distinguished Batch chosen plaintext attack where the cryptanalysis cryptanalyst chooses all plaintexts before any of them are encrypted This is an unprofessional use of chosen plaintext attack Adaptive chosen plaintext attack where the professional cryptanalysis cryptanalyst makes a series of interactive queries choosing subsequent plaintexts based on the information from the previous encryptions
