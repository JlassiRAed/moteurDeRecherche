 Simultaneous multithreading acronym SMT is a technique for improving the overall efficiency of superscalar Central processing unit CPUs with Multithreading Hardware multithreading SMT permits multiple independent thread thread s of execution to better utilize the resources provided by modern computer architecture s Multithreading is similar in concept to multitasking but is implemented at the thread thread level of execution in modern superscalar processors In processor design there are two ways to increase on chip Parallel computing parallelism with less resource requirements Superscalar technique which tries to increase Instruction level parallelism to multiple redundant execution unit s built inside the processor Chip level multithreading in order to executes instructions from multiple threads within one processor chip at the same time There are many ways to support more than one thread inside a chip namely Interleaved multithreading Coarse grain multithreading is more common for less context switch between threads For processors with one pipeline per core interleaved multithreading is the only possible way because it can only issue up to one instruction per cycle Simultaneous multithreading Issue multiple instructions from multiple threads in one cycle The processor must be superscalar to do so Chip level multiprocessing threads independently Any combination of IMT SMT CMP The key factor to distinguish them is to look at how many instructions the processor can issue in one cycle and how many threads from which the instructions come
