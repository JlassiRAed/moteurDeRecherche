 David Hume was a philosopher and historian from Scotland When he was still alive people thought of him as a historian He wrote a series of large books called The History of England But today people think of Hume as an important philosopher In his books on philosophy Hume said that many of our beliefs do not come from wikt reason reason Instead they come from our instinct s or emotion feeling s For example reason does not tell us that one thing causes another Instead we see one thing and then we see another and we feel a link between the two Similarly reason does not tell us that someone is a good person Instead we see that the person is kind and friendly and we feel a special moral feeling Because Hume thought that these beliefs do not come from reason people call him a skeptical or anti rationalist philosopher Hume is famous for his Induction Fallacy This draws attention to a common mistake people make People see something and make claims that what they see will always be as they see it For example people see only white swans and claim that all swans are white This is fallacious or mistaken because it is always possible that they then will see a black swan Hume was also skeptical about religion He was not a religious person and religious people did not like his opinions He did not believe in miracles He said that suicide wasn t always wrong but never said whether or not he believed in God In when he was dying he was very nice to his friends and very calm about death Many people were amazed about this because they thought Hume was going to hell Today Hume s books are very important to philosophers who are interested in religion Today s philosophers sometimes use the term Hume s fork to refer to Hume calling everything we can think about either a relation of ideas Another philosopher Immanuel Kant read some of Hume s books and changed his mind about some important things Kant said Hume had made him wake up from a sleeping dogmatism the traditional metaphysics Here are Hume s most important books In this large book Hume talks about the human mind and tries to figure out how it works He talks about knowledge cause and effect emotions right and wrong and many other things In this small book Hume talks about many of the same things from the Treatise like knowledge and cause and effect He tried to make this book easy to read This is another small book and again Hume tried to make it easy to read The book is about right and wrong In this book Hume has three characters who argue with each other about God
