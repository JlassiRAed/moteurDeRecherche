The Riemann hypothesis is a mathematical conjecture Many people think that finding a Mathematical proof proof of the hypothesis is one of the hardest and most important unsolved problems of pure mathematics The hypothesis is named after Bernhard Riemann It is about a special Function zeros of the zeta function Many zeros have been found The obvious ones to find are the negative even integers This follows from Riemann s functional equation More have been computed and have real number real part The hypothesis states all the undiscovered zeros must have real part The functional equation also says all zeros If the hypothesis is false this would mean that there are white dots which are not on the line given If proven correct this would allow mathematician s to better describe how the prime number s are placed among whole numbers The Riemann hypothesis is so important and so difficult to prove that the Clay Mathematics Institute has offered to the first person to prove it
