 Backspace is the keyboard key that originally pushed the typewriter carriage one position backwards and for modern computer screens moves the cursor one position backwards deletes the preceding character and shifts back the text after it by one position In typewriters a typist would for example type a lowercase letter a with acute accent Backspace composition no longer works with digital displays or typesetting systems It has to some degree been replaced with the combining diacritical mark s mechanism of Unicode though such characters do not work well with many fonts and precomposed characters continue to be used Some software like TeX or Microsoft Windows use the opposite method for diacritical marks namely positioning the accent first and then placing the base letter at that position Pressing the backspace key on a computer terminal would generate the ASCII code BS or Backspace a control code which would delete the preceding character That control code could also be accessed by pressing Control H as H is the eighth letter of the Latin alphabet Terminals which did not have the backspace code mapped to the function of moving the cursor backwards and deleting the preceding character would display the symbols H when the backspace key was pressed This sequence is still used humorously for epanorthosis by computer literates denoting the deletion of a pretended blunder much like a strikethrough Example My slave dri H H H H H H H H Hboss decided to stall the project A more concise alternative sometimes seen is W which is the shortcut to delete the previous word in the Berkeley Unix terminal line discipline One W can replace a whole string of H s This shortcut has also made it into the Vi text editor For really embarrassing blunders U can outdo a series of W The backspace is distinct from the delete key which in paper media for computers would punch out all the holes to strike out a character and in modern computers deletes text following it Also the delete key often works as a generic command to remove an object while backspace usually has no effect In modern systems the backspace key is often mapped to the delete character although the backspace key s function of deleting the character before the cursor remains In a Mainframe computer mainframe environment to backspace means to move a magnetic tape backwards typically to the previous block The backspace key is commonly used to go back a page when exploring folders in graphical environments or when browsing the World Wide Web Web in web browser s Although the term backspace is the standard name of the key which deletes the character to the left of the cursor the actual key may be labelled in a variety of ways for example delete
