 Data mining is a term from computer science Sometimes it is also called knowledge discovery in databases Data mining is about finding new information in a lot of Information data The information obtained from data mining is hopefully both new and useful In many cases data is stored so it can be used later The data is saved with a goal For example a store wants to save what has been bought They want to do this to know how much they should buy themselves to have enough to sell later Saving this information makes a lot of data The data is usually saved in a database The reason why data is saved is called the first use Later the same data can also be used to get other information that was not needed for the first use The store might want to know now what kind of things people buy together when they buy at the store That kind of information is in the data and is useful but was not the reason why the data was saved This information is new and can be useful It is a second use for the same data Finding new information that can also be useful from data is called data mining
