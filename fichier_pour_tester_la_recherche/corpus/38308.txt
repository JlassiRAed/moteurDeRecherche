 An amine is a molecule which has a nitrogen atom that can behave as a base base An amine can be thought of coming from ammonia The difference is that the three hydrogen s in ammonia are changed to any group or atom If only one of the hydrogens is changed the amine is called primary If two are changed the amine is called secondary If all three are changed then it is called tertiary Sometimes a fourth group can be added to the nitrogen This is called a quaternary ammonium cation This is not an amine but is a salt If one of the groups on the nitrogen is a carbonyl group then the molecule is called amide This has very different properties Amines are used a lot in chemistry Since the nitrogen has a lone pair it can do many chemical reaction reaction s It can take proton s away from some acid s It can also be a nucleophile It can be changed into imine s and other functional group s Amines are also found in many protein s They are a part of every amino acid
