The human brain has two halves called the left and right cerebral hemisphere hemispheres These two halves of the brain are not exactly alike For most tasks both sides of the brain work together But each side of the brain specializes in some things and works harder on those things than the other side The term brain lateralization or lateralization of brain function means that the different halves do things differently
