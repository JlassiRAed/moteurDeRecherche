 Relativistic jets are very powerful jets of plasma plasma with speeds close to the speed of light If the jet speed is close to the speed of light the effects of the special theory of relativity are significant The mechanics behind how jets are created Massive galactic central black holes have the most powerful jets Similar jets on a much smaller scale develop from neutron star s and black holes in other stars Even weaker and less relativistic jets may be associated with many binary star systems The general hypothesis among astrophysicists is that the formation of relativistic jets is the key to explaining the production of gamma ray burst s These jets have Lorentz factor s of or greater making them some of the fastest celestial objects known at present
