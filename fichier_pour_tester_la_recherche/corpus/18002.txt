The electric eel Electrophorus electricus is a species of fish It can weigh up to six pounds It can give electric shocks of up to six hundred fifty watt s of electricity The animal uses these shocks both for hunting and to defend itself It lives in the stagnant muddy river bottoms of the Orinoco and the Amazon River Amazon and uses low voltage electric field s to find its prey The electric eel is an apex predator in the parts of South America where it lives This means it usually has no enemies except other animals of its own species It can kill animals larger than itself Its electric organs evolved from muscles and make up four fifths of its body Froese Rainer and Pauly Daniel eds Electrophorus electricus in FishBase Despite its name the electric eel is not an eel It is a Gymnotiformes knifefish It is an obligatory air breather This makes sense because the muddy water is very low in oxygen and it needs oxygen to power its electric organs Because they can shock very few of these fish are kept as pets But if the eel repeatedly shocks its electric organs become completely discharged Then a person can touch it without being shocked
