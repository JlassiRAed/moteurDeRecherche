 Electric charge is a basic property of electron s proton s and other subatomic particle s Electrons are negatively charged while protons are positively charged Things that are negatively charged and things that are positively charged pull on This is called the Law of Charges It was discovered by Charles Augustin de Coulomb The law that describes how strongly charges pull and push on each other is called Coulomb s law Coulomb s Law Things that have equal numbers of electrons and protons are neutral Things that have more electrons than protons are negatively charged while things with fewer electrons than protons are positively charged Things with the same charge repel each other Things that have different charges attract each other If possible the one with too many electrons will give enough electrons to match the number of protons in the one that has too many protons for its load of electrons If there are just enough electrons to match the extra protons then the two things will not attract each other anymore When electrons move from a place where there are too many to a place where there are too few that is called an electrical current When a person shuffles their feet on a carpet and then touches a brass doorknob he or she may get an electrical shock If there are enough extra electrons then the force with which those electrons push each other away may be enough to make some of the electrons jump across a gap between the person and the doorknob The length of the spark is a measure of voltage or electrical pressure The number of electrons that move from one place to another per unit of time measured as amperage or rate of electron flow If a person gets a positive or negative charge it may make the person s hairs stand up because the charges in each hair push it away from the others Electric charge felt when one gets a shock from a doorknob or other object usually is between thousand and thousand volts However the amperage involved is incredibly low so the flow of electrons through the person s body can not cause physical harm On the other hand when clouds gain electrical charges they have even higher voltages and the amperage and if those electrons go through a person then that person will be burned and may die
