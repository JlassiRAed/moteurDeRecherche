An instruction set is a list of all the Instruction instructions with all their variations that a processor can execute Instructions include An instruction set or instruction set architecture the native commands implemented by a particular central processing unit design Instruction set architecture is distinguished from microarchitecture which is the detailed description of the system that is sufficient for completely describing the operation of all parts of the computing system as well as how they are inter connected and inter operate to implement the ISA Computers with different microarchitecture s can share a common instruction set For example the Intel Pentium and the AMD Athlon implement nearly identical versions of the x instruction set but they are very different in internal designs
