The categorical imperative is an idea that the philosopher Immanuel Kant had about ethics Kant said that an imperative is something that a person must do For example if a person wants to stop being thirsty it is imperative that they have a drink Kant said an imperative is categorical when it is true at all times and in all situations The example of a thirsty person Kant named the Hypothetical imperative Hypothetical Imperative Kant used the hypothetical imperative to explain his ideas about the ethics of a categorical imperative For example it is not usually a moral choice when a person decides to drink water no matter why they are drinking the water If a person is very thirsty then it is a hypothetical imperative that they drink the water Instead of the hypothetical imperative Kant said that the moral choices are governed by a categorical imperative The categorical imperative is something that a person must do no matter what the circumstances It is imperative to an ethical person that they make choices based on the categorical imperative Another way of saying that is that an ethical person follows a universal law regardless of their situation Kant explained his ideas about following the categorical imperative by introducing one more idea he called a maxim A maxim is another way of saying what we want to do and why we want to do it in one sentence We can learn ethical maxims by applying the test of the categorical imperative And he said we can live ethical lives if we use these maxims whenever we make decisions The categorical imperative hypothetical imperative and the maxim can all be seen in the example of the thirsty man There are many philosophies of ethics and many philosophers who have very different opinions Some philosophers might say that it would have been ethical if Thirsty Man had kept the bottle for himself to drink It was his bottle to begin with and he could do whatever he wanted with it Other philosophers might say that Thirsty Man was ethically wrong to give the bottle to Dying Man because the water ended up choking the Dying Man to death Kant s idea of the categorical imperative would say that Thirsty Man made the right choice for the right reasons and he made those ethical decisions in a logical way An important part of Kant s idea is that the morality of a choice is based on why we make the choice Kant elaborated on these ideas by saying that we should treat other persons as persons and not as tool s who can help us in some way He said we should do this based on the ethical duty that all persons have to each other an ethical duty which could be called a universal law Kant s ideas about this universal law and the categorical imperative are important basic components of the philosophy of Absolutism
