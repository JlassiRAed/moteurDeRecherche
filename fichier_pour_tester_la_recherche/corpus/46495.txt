 Numerical Control is a way to automate machine s In numerical control the commands these machines get come from a storage medium they are not controlled and operated manually The first such machines were Jacquard loom s controlled by punched cards Machine tools for cutting metal were built in the s and s They used punched card punched tape instructions Soon the tools were changed to use computer s Numerical control with computers is known as Computerized numerical control or CNC Nowadays it is possible to make a program that can run on such machine tools based on a Computer aided technologies CAD drawing of the piece to be produced Attempts to automate machines in the th century for example copying lathes used cam s These are basically wheels that change the position of notches to control a machine The basic difference to modern NC is that these cams only automated one given task modern NC and CNC machines can be programmed to a greater extent
