An electric circuit is a path in which electrons from a voltage or Electric current current source flow The point where those electrons enter an electrical circuit is called the source of electrons The point where the electrons leave an electrical circuit is called the return or earth ground The exit point is called the return because electrons always end up at the source when they complete the path of an electrical circuit The part of an electrical circuit that is between the electrons starting point and the point where they return to the source is called an electrical circuit s load The load of an electrical circuit may be as simple as those that power electrical appliances like refrigerator s televisions or  lamp s or more complicated such as the load on the output of a  Hydropower hydroelectric Power station power generating station Circuits use two forms of electrical power alternating current AC often powers large appliances and motors and is generated by power station s DC powers battery operated Electric car vehicles and other machines and electronics Converters can change AC to DC and vice versa High voltage direct current transmission uses very big converters
