 Graphene is one of the forms of carbon Like diamond s and graphite the forms form of a number of D allotropes such as graphite charcoal fullerene and carbon nanotube s The term graphene was coined as a combination of graphite and the suffix ene by Hanns Peter Boehm Graphene is like a honeycomb or chicken wire structure made of carbon atoms and their bonds Graphite is many graphene sheets stacked together Three million graphene sheets stacked to form graphite would be only one millimeter millimetre thick The Nobel Prize in Physics for was awarded to Sir Andre Geim and Sir Konstantin Novoselov for groundbreaking experiments regarding the D two dimensional material graphene
