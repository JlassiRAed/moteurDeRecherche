 Pack is the name given to canine s which live and hunt together That means the dog tribe known as the Canini It does not apply to foxes So not all canids form packs If they do the size of the pack and the social behaviour in the pack varies by species The animals in the pack know each other Always there is a hierarchy of dominance dominance inside the pack The classic case is the grey wolf All packs are united by genetic relationship they are family members One reason why some mammal ian predators evolved group behaviour is that their prey lives in massive herd s on grassland The most notable predators on grassland are the wolves and jackals The same principle works with aquatic predators if their prey goes in shoal s or family groups then the predators go in groups
