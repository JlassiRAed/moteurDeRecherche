 Artificial selection is the intentional breeding of plants or animals It means the same thing as selective breeding Selective breeding is a technique used when breed ing domestication domesticated animal s such as dog s pigeon s or cattle Some of these animals may have Trait traits that a breeder will want to carry over to the next generation The breeder will therefore select those animals to breed which have that quality rather than those that do not Inbreeding is a particular kind of selective breeding designed to produce a population which is genetically virtually identical Such populations are rarely viable outside the laboratory They lose fertility To control this most breeds are Outcrossing outcrossed or backcrossed to wild type individuals or at least less inbred stock This is done every so many generations the details differ from breed to breed The improvement when outcrossing is done is called hybrid vigour Charles Darwin used the example of artificial selection to introduce his idea of natural selection Artificial selection may be contrasted with the process of natural selection In natural selection the differential reproduction of organisms with certain traits happens This is because some variations help the organism to have better survival and reproduction The process maintains or enhances the fitness of a population in its natural habitat Artificial selection may sometimes be unintentional it is thought that domestication of crops by early humans was largely unintentional
