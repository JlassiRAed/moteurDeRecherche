The paradox of thrift is the idea that during a recession people will want to save more money But if everyone saves money then the economy can slow down even more reducing peoples income as a result It is often linked with John Maynard Keynes It is a main theory of Keynesian economics It is a kind of prisoner s dilemma saving benefits each individual but damages the general population This is a paradox because it is contrary to wikt intuition intuition Someone might think that what seems to be good for an individual in the economy will be good for the entire population However exercising thrift may be good for an individual by enabling that individual to save for a rainy day and yet not be good for the economy as a whole There is little agreement as to how important this is in a modern economy Modern economies are huge and much affected by other national economies
