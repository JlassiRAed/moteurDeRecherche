A propeller makes an airplane aircraft ship or submarine in water or air go by making a big wind or a strong stream It does this by turning two or more wing s very quick The blades of a propeller act as rotating wing s and produce force through application of both Bernoulli s principle and Newton s laws of motion Newton s third law generating a difference in pressure between the forward and rear surfaces of the airfoil shaped blades
