 Quantum mechanics is the part of physics that tells us how the subatomic particle things that make up atoms work QM also tells us how electromagnetic waves like light work QM is a mathematics mathematical framework for much of modern physics and chemistry Quantum mechanics helps us make sense of the smallest things in nature like proton s neutron s and electron s Complex mathematics is used to study subatomic particles and electromagnetic waves because they act in very strange ways Quantum mechanics is important to physics and chemistry Quantum is a Latin word that means how much So a quantum of energy is a specific amount of energy Light sources such as candle s or laser s shoot out light in bits called photon s Photons are like packets Each one has a certain little bit of energy
