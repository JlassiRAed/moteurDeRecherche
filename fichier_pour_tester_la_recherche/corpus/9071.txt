If you really want to ruin our project that badly why not Go ahead But be warned there are a lot of consequences A nasty warning goes on your talk page which might ruin a future WP RfA RfA or WP RfB RfB You eventually get blocked stopping you from editing or getting WP RfR rollback rights When you sockpuppet the wiki to evade your indef block a checkuser blocks you again forcing you off the wiki forever Bulbapedia winds up calling Wikipedia and finds out you ve been blocked Their checkusers kick you out That eventually leads to you using Wikia as a last resort But then you realize the real reason you vandalized is because you were testing And without knowing the wiki format how can you make your very own wiki And this eventually means your whole life will revolve around finding other wikis to burrow in Unfortunately all their checkusers kick you out So please do not vandalize UNLESS you want to get kicked out forever which I believe no one wants
