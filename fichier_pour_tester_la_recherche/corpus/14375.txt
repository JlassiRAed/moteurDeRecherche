A caldera is a volcanic feature formed by the collapse of land surface after a gigantic volcanic eruption In such an eruption the volcano s magma chamber is empty enough for the ground above it to drop A caldera may look like a volcanic crater except that a crater is made by blasting outward not by collapsing inward cite webWhen Yellowstone Caldera last erupted some years ago it released about km of material covering much of North America in debris up to two metres thick By comparison when Mount St Helens erupted in it released times less material The ecological effects of the eruption of a large caldera can be seen in the record of the Lake Toba eruption in Indonesia
