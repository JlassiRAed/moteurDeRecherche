 Mendelian inheritance is a set of rules about genetics genetic inheritance The basic rules of genetics were first discovered by a monk named Gregor Mendel in the s and published in For thousands of years people had noticed how Trait traits are inherited from parents to their children However Mendel s work was different because he did experiment s on plant s and designed those experiments very carefully In his experiments Mendel studied how traits were passed on in pea plants He started his crosses with plants that bred true and counted characters that were either or in nature He bred large numbers of plants and expressed his results numerically He used test crosses to reveal the presence and proportion of recessive characters
