 Bioinorganic chemistry studies the role of metal s in biology It also studies natural wikt phenomena phenomena such as the behaviour of metalloprotein s and artificially introduced metals in medicine and toxicology Many physiology biological processes such as cellular respiration respiration depend on some inorganic molecules Bioinorganic chemistry also includes the study of inorganic model s or wikt mimics mimics that wikt imitate imitate the way metalloproteins work It is a mix of biochemistry and inorganic chemistry Bioinorganic chemistry studies the implications for biology of electron transfer protein s substrate substrate bindings and activation atom and group chemistry as well as metal properties
