 Translation is the second part of protein biosynthesis It is part of the process of gene expression Before translation comes Transcription transcription which produces a chain of intron s and exon s RNA splicing by spliceosome s which remove introns and formulation of the messenger RNA from exons In eukaryote s translation happens on the ribosome s in the cytoplasm and in the endoplasmic reticulum In bacteria translation happens in the cell cytoplasm they have no Cell nucleus nucleus Ribosomes are made of a small part and a large part which surround the mRNA In translation mRNA has the base sequence to make a specific polypeptide This sequence is originally specified by the DNA and copied by the mRNA The polypeptide can be a whole protein Or it can be just a part waiting to be combined with other polypeptides so it can make a whole protein The polypeptide also has to be folded before it works as a protein Amino acid s are carried by specific tRNA s with anticodon s to connect with mRNA s matching codon s Each tRNA has its own anticodon and carries an amino acid An anticodon is always together with the same amino acid When the tRNA matches with the mRNA the amino acid that is connected to the tRNA is unconnected from the tRNA and connected to the amino acid brought by the previous tRNA So a ribosome works a lot like a stock ticker and ticker tape Many ribosomes together with mRNA will attach themselves to the outer cell membrane
