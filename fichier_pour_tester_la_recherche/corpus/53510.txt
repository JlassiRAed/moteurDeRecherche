 Concrete is an important material for making different building s and structure s It is a composite made of Portland cement sand gravel or aggregate and water in varying proportions depending on the task Concrete is used more than any other man made material in the world The ingredients are mixed together into a paste a bit like making dough for bread The concrete is then wikt pour poured into a frame After a few hours it sets hard Concrete solidifies due to a chemical reaction known as hydration The water reacts with the cement which bonds the other components together eventually creating a strong stone like material Concrete is used to make Sidewalk pavements pipe Architecture architectural structure s Foundation foundation s motorway s bridge s multi story parking wall s footing s for gate s fence s and Utility pole poles and even boat s Its biggest advantage is that it bond s together bricks and stones better than any other method known to mankind Concrete is wikt strong strong in compression but wikt weak weak in tension For some purposes it needs to be reinforced with steel rods Reinforced concrete buildings can be made to link all the parts together the foundations walls floors and roofs but concrete construction does not make buildings Earthquake engineering earthquake proof Concrete is as old as BC It was not invented by Ancient Rome Romans but much used by them Some kinds of concrete are wikt waterproof waterproof and some kinds even set underwater
