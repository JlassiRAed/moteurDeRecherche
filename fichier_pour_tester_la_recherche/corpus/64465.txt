The Simplex algorithm is an algorithm which is used to solve problems of Linear programming or linear optimization It was first used by George Dantzig in but other people like Kantorovich laid the foundations in The algorithm runs in two steps First a solution to the problem is found or the certainty that no solution exists The solution found earlier is improved if this is possible Step is run multiple times Each time a given solution is improved until this is no longer possible
