The brainstem is the rear part of the brain It has two sections the hindbrain which includes the pons and the midbrain Though the brainstem is small it is extremely important The motor and sensory connections from the main part of the brain to the rest of the body pass through the brain stem Also from the brainstem come the main motor and sensory nerve s to the face and neck These nerves are called the cranial nerve s The brainstem controls many bodily functions of which we are not normally aware such as breathing heart beat and sweat ing The brainstem controls functions which are unconscious but necessary for life The hindbrain is the medulla oblongata which is an extension of the spinal cord It connects the other parts of the brain to the spinal cord Its neuron s are the control centre of bodily functions such as breathing and blood pressure
