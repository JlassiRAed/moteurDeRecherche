 Phalaena jacobaeae Noctua jacobaeae Tyria confluens Callimorpha senecionis The cinnabar moth Cinnabar moths are day flying insects Like many other Animal coloration brightly colored moths it cannot be eaten The larvae use members of the genus Senecio as foodplants Newly hatched larvae feed from under the ragwort leaves to the area of their old eggs The larvae absorb toxic and bitter tasting alkaloid substances from the foodplants This makes them unable to be eaten themselves Like several other Arctiidae moth larvae the cinnabar caterpillars can turn cannibalistic This can be due to lack of food Sometimes they can eat other cinnabar larvae for no apparent reason They can grow up to mm and are voracious eaters large populations can strip entire patches of ragwort clean a result of their low predation Many do not survive to the pupal stage This is mainly due to them completely consuming the food source before reaching maturity This could be a possible explanation for their tendency to engage in seemingly random cannibalistic behaviour It is common for them to die from starvation The moth has proven to be successful as a biocontrol agent for ragwort when used in conjunction with the Longitarsus jacobaeae ragwort flea beetle in the western United States Image Tyria jacobaeae pupa jpg PupaImage Tyria jacobaeae jpg Adult showing hindwingsFile Tyria jacobaeae mating jpg MatingImage BritishentomologyvolumePlate jpg Illustration from John Curtis s British Entomology Volume
