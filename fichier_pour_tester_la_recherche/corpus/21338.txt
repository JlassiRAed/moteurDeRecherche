In algebra and calculus the complex plane is the coordinate system in which complex numbers are graphed The vertical axis is the imaginary axis and the horizontal axis is the real axis Basically in the complex number of the form a bi you go a spaces on the real axis and b spaces on the imaginary axis The complex plane can also be expressed in the form of polar coordinates in which the magnitude of the line is equal to the square root of a plus b and the direction is a specified angle as in normal polar coordinates
