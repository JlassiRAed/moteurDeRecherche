A boycott is a protest where the protesters do not buy a product product or give money to a company Instead of buying a certain product they might also buy another very similar product from a different company The word was made during the Irish Land War It comes from the name of Captain Charles Boycott Boycott was in charge of looking after the land of a landlord in County Mayo Ireland In the tenant s wanted their rent lowered Boycott refused and threw them out of the land they had rented The Irish Land League then proposed that instead of becoming violence violent everyone in the community should stop doing business with Captain Boycott The captain was soon isolated No one helped him with the harvest no one worked in his stable s or his house Local businessmen no longer traded with him the postman no longer delivered his post To get his harvest done he had to hire people from other counties the counties County Cavan Cavan and County Monaghan Monaghan They were escorted to and from their work by policemen Of course this cost far more than what the harvest was worth
