 Elementbox Helium is a chemical element It has the chemical symbol He atomic number and atomic weight of about There are isotopes of helium only two of which are stable These are He is by far the most common isotope Helium is called a noble gas because it does not regularly mix with other chemicals and form new Chemical compound compounds It has the lowest boiling point of all the elements It is the second most common element in the universe after hydrogen and has no color or smell However Helium has a blue ish neon color when being burnt with fire Helium does not usually Chemical reaction react with anything else Astronomers discovered helium in They found that it was in the Sun before it was found on Earth Because of where it was found its name comes from the Greek language Greek word for Sun helios Helium is used to fill balloon s and airship s because it is density lighter than air and does not burn or react meaning it is normally safe for using it in that way It is also used in some kinds of light bulbs People also breathe it in to make their voice s sound higher than they normally do as a joke but this is extremely dangerous if they breathe in too much since it can kill them because they are not breathing normal air Breathing too much helium can also cause long term effects to vocal cords It can be created through the process of nuclear fusion in the Sunderland A F C sun we are currently trying to harness nuclear fusion as a form of power but this is still at an early stage because the sun can Quantum tunneling quantum tunnel enough because of its huge size During this process four Hydrogen atoms are fused together to form one Helium atom
