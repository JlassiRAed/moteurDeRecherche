This essay Add wikilinked sections to balance NPOV describes a technique for resolving the age old question How can an outrageous claim be mentioned in an article while also defusing all the wild implications of that claim For example sources might state Movie star XX had been arrested when a teenager on charges of prostitution Such a claim when stated in an article could imply guilt as noted unless thoroughly refuted with ample details to counter the suspicions raised by the claim To omit a major claim totally might be a case of censorship so the problem is how to offset a claim while maintaining NPOV neutral balance in the text In general an article can be expanded to provide more balance in accordance with policy WP NPOV by wikilinking to sections which elaborate the details about The Rest of the Story As an example consider the handling of some highly controversial topics within a hypothetical crime article Location map many Suppose that reliable sources for a crime article had reported an extreme viewpoint of the house seeming thoroughly cleaned with bleach but then the article immediately countered that extreme claim by linking an opposing section such as Claims of bleach refuted at trial That structure allows both ideas to appear side by side as similar phrases but also connects to a detailed explanation listing all the details of the trial testimonies where perhaps housekeepers said the household bleach had remained unused with no smell of bleach and investigators found no chemical trace of bleaching or bleach spots on fabrics at the scene Luminol testing found no wide areas wiped with bleach only bare footprints or smaller splotches in separate areas such as might occur by stepping in spilled fruit juice or walking through shower cleanser Such a dedicated section of specific details could be used to provide the NPOV balance without cluttering the article s text at the phrase where the idea of bleaching was initially mentioned Totally removing any text about bleach from the article would be censorship as an act of suppressing a notorious controversy in the criminal case Sometimes a one phrase extreme claim could only be fully rebutted by several sentences and so an equal word count view of the overall balance tends to thwart adding all the necessary details to refute a claim for an adequate neutral coverage Instead a one phrase extreme claim can be followed by a wikilinked sub section title which in much more detail will then offset the impact of the original extreme claim For example The initial phrase the Earth is flat gives the impression that Aristotle was clueless about the Earth s rotation However that would be refuted in the wikilinked sub section Aristotle view of Earth as pie plate rotating on edge The initial sentence is very short but all the details would be elaborated in the linked section of how Aristotle wrote of the Earth as a flat pie plate standing on edge rotating on edge This technique would lead to a similar offset by wikilink in a hypothetical crime article such as the sentence They suggested the event began as a sex game Using that tactic for every time the text must mention sex game then immediately link to the total rebuttal as section No evidence of sex game found and offset them every time when mentioned to sustain a neutral NPOV balance
