The term Radio frequency refers to electromagnetic radiation in the range of frequencies lower than microwave s Radio wave s at these frequencies have been found useful for long range communications Among these frequencies shortwave radio communications operate at frequencies that can be reflected by the ionosphere and therefore can bounce around the earth Long wave frequencies are used for relatively short range communications such as the most ordinary of the commercial amplitude modulation radio stations Their transmissions ordinarily do not get long bounces Different short wave frequencies will change operating frequencies from month to month and also from time to time during a hour period
