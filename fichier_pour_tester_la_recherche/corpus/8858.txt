In chemistry a homologous series is a series of chemical compound s with the same general formula Example s of such series are the Open chain compound straight chained alkane s Compounds within a homologous series typically have a wikt fixed fixed set of functional group s that gives them similar Chemical property chemical and Physical property physical properties For example the series of primary straight chained alcohol s has an hydroxyl at the end of the carbon chain These properties typically change gradually along the series and the changes can often be explained by small differences in Molecule molecular size and mass
