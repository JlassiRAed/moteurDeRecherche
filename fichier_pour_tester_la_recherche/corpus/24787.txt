 Chemical stability refers to the resistance of a chemical to change in a chemical reaction Some chemicals like gold are very stable and resistant to change but sodium is unstable and corrodes rapidly in the presence of air When an atom has an extra electron or a missing electron it is unstable When that atom loses or gains the electron it becomes stable Stable atoms have lower energy than unstable ones
