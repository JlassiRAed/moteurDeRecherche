 Fold mountains are mountain s formed mainly by the effects of fold folding on layers in the upper part of the Earth s crust The term is rather out of date though still fairly common in physical geography literature In the time before plate tectonics became well understood the term was used for mountain belts such as the Himalayas These mountain ranges are not caused by the folding of the earth s crust The main mechanism causing a thickening of the crust at these sites of continent continent collision along a convergent boundary is thrust fault ing Fold mountains are formed when two tectonic plates move together Fold mountains are usually formed from sedimentary rocks which accumulated along the margins of continents When plates and the continents riding on them collide the accumulated layers of rock may crumple and fold like a tablecloth that is pushed across a table particularly if there is a mechanically weak basal layer such as halite salt
