 Magnetic reluctance or magnetic resistance is a measurement used in the analysis of magnetic circuit s It is like Electrical resistance resistance in an electrical Electrical network circuit but rather than dissipating magnetic energy it stores magnetic energy As an electric field causes an electric current to follow the path of least resistance a magnetic field causes magnetic flux to follow the path of least magnetic reluctance It is a scalar scalar Intensive and extensive properties Extensive quantity extensive quantity like electrical resistance Reluctance is usually represented by a curly capital R
