We will be working with about students to do some editing on Simple English Wikipedia Students will add content to pages of notable African American innovators They will be using Biography com and library resources as their reference material They will cite the sources they reference in the Simple English Wikipedia article Given that multiple authors will be editing the same article it will not make sense for them to use their individual sandbox to edit the page so please bear with us as the pages are being developed The class occurs from PM PM United States Central Time on Tuesday afternoons until May
