 Atmospheric convection is caused by one of two possibilities One is instable state of atmosphere The second is different ability of Earth s surface to get warmer The first type can be called contact convection Spontaneous convection starts at any level Contact convection starts near the terrain The most frequent is contact convection The sun is shining on the surface It gets warmer and warmer This leads to vertical draft that is spontaneous rising and downward motions This warm air has higher temperature than its neighborhood Warmer air has lower density than cold air Warm air rises Through this rising motion the air element decelerates because of friction This trend stops when the temperature of this element is equal to the temperature of surrounding air Next rising continues due to inertia These thermal motions are used for example in gliding The Thermal flow has enough energy to bring gliders to higher altitude
