The Ford Mustang is a very popular United States American sports car built by the Ford Motor Company beginning in The first cars were built in Ford s Dearborn Michigan factory on March of that year and the car was first shown to the public on April at the New York World s Fair It did not cost a lot of money but it was still very fancy and looked like a much more expensive car People could order their Mustang with many options and body styles such as a convertible or coupe Many different engines were available from the CID six cylinder to some of Ford s biggest and most powerful V engines in later years This meant car buyers could have a Mustang that saved gas or a more powerful and fast car More than one million Mustangs were sold in only two years The Mustang is still being sold today and is still very popular It was so popular and so different when it was introduced that the Mustang and other cars from other makers which looked like the Mustang were given the name ponycar The so called Mustang was designed by Joe Oros and Dave Ash of Ford s Mercury division was based on another Ford car the Ford Falcon Falcon and was proposed by Ford s president Lee Iacocca The Falcon was not expensive to build and that helped Iacocca get the Mustang the approval it needed to be built The people who ran the Ford company did not want to take a chance on a car like that because they lost a lot of money on another car the Edsel just a few years back It set sales records and became one of the best selling cars of all time It would remain mostly the same until So popular was the Mustang that three Ford assembly plants worked to build it Not only was the Mustang built in Dearborn but in Metuchen New Jersey and San Jose California as well The very first Mustang built to be sold to the public was a white convertible with a black interior and a V engine It was purchased by a pilot from Newfoundland Ford offered the one millionth Mustang to the owner in exchange for the first one That first Mustang serial number FF is still on display at the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn Its second body style came out in its third in and its fourth in Bigger more powerful engines were offered starting in making some Mustangs into musclecars Some of those special Mustangs had special names such as Mustang GT Mach Boss Boss Boss and SCJ or Super Cobra Jet By the Mustang had become a much larger car The car grew in size so that Ford could put its biggest engines in it but insurance companies were charging very high prices to insure powerful cars and sales began to drop Many people missed the original smaller Mustang A new Mustang came out in called Ford Mustang II Mustang II and was based on the Ford Pinto although far less than the original car had been based on the Falcon This new car was almost the same size as the original car but emissions controls and the Arab oil embargo meant that the Mustang II was not a very powerful car was not only the first time Ford had built a car which looked like an older model it was also the first American car to be built on the metric system The short low hood meant that neither the inline six cylinder engine nor V would fit so engine choices were changed to a liter four cylinder engine built by Ford in Brazil and a more expensive V engine built by Ford in Germany A liter V engine was offered in which meant that Ford engineers had to redesign much of the car to make it fit No matter which engine was used the Mustang II was a heavier car than the model The Mustang II helped keep the ponycar alive between and General Motors almost stopped building their popular Chevrolet Camaro and Pontiac Firebird Chrysler Corporation stopped building the Dodge Challenger and Plymouth Barracuda during that time General Motors stopped building the Camaro in but they brought back a new version in Chrysler brought back a new Challenger in as well they like today s Mustang are made to look like older models The new Mustang that came out in may have been the most important Mustang ever One reason was the return of a powerful V in which was developed in later years into an even more powerful engine The basic design carried all the way through the model year but with hundreds of thousands of improvements over the years Very few parts except for some minor chassis parts stayed unchanged The model was the first all new Mustang since Because the original Mustang was and is one of the most popular cars ever Ford made the new Mustang coupe and convertible look very much like the first Mustangs especially the and models The engines of the Mustang were based on the older engines but had more power The liter V engine made hp and the liter V hp which rose to hp on the Bullitt All models were available with manual and automatic transmissions Both Ford and Carroll Shelby recently brought back the a new version of the very fast Shelby GT Mustang in Mr Shelby helped create the special Shelby GT and GT versions of the Mustang beginning in The Shelby GT had a liter V which produced hp In a KR version with hp was added The Mustang in turn looks much like the model but all the body parts except for the roof are different The rear turn signal s of the cars blink in a one two three sequence like the Mercury Cougar and Ford Thunderbird Power for the V rose to hp In the Mustang received new engines a liter V base engine with hp and a new liter engine with hp Power on the Shelby GT rose to hp and later to hp in A Boss performance version powered by a hp V was introduced for For a completely new
