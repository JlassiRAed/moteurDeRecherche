A pseudanthium Pseudanthia are characteristic of the daisy and sunflower family Their flowers are either ray flowers or disk flowers The disk flowers in the center of the pseudanthium look like the centre of a normal flower Flowers on the periphery have one large petal This sytem is unique to this family Either ray or disk flowers may be absent in some species Senecio vulgaris lacks ray flowers The pseudanthium has a whorl of bract s below the flowers At a glance a pseudanthium looks just like a normal flower but closer inspection shows it is composed of multiple flowers Thus the pseudanthium represents an evolution of the inflorescence to a reproductive unit that may function in pollination like a single flower at least in plants that are animal pollinated The advantage of this flower is that it produces far more seeds than a normal flower but needs only one act of pollination
