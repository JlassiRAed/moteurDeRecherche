A chromophore is the part of a molecule responsible for its colour The colour is caused when a molecule Absorption absorbs certain wavelength s of visible spectrum visible light It transmits or reflects only other wavelengths which causes the colour we see In biological molecules that capture or detect light energy the chromophore is the Functional group part of the molecule which responds when hit by light Chromophores make the colour in chromatophore s which are the pigment containing and light reflecting cells found in many animals
