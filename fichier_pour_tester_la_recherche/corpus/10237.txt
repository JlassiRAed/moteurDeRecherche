 Myco heterotrophy is a relationship between certain plants and fungi The plant gets all or part of its food from parasitism on fungi not from from photosynthesis In the past non photosynthetic plants were thought to get food by breaking down organic matter like fungi do Such plants were therefore called Saprotroph saprophytes This was wrong It is now known that no plant is physiology physiologically capable of direct breakdown of organic matter To get food non photosynthetic plants engage in parasitism by myco heterotrophy or direct parasitism of other plants The interface between the plant and fungal partners in this association is between the roots of the plant and the mycelium of the fungus Myco heterotrophy therefore closely resembles mycorrhiza and is thought to have evolved from mycorrhiza
