The Hubble Space Telescope across The telescope can take pictures of things so far away it would be nearly impossible to see them from anywhere else It actually observes less than of the time It was made by both NASA and the ESA working together It is km in Outer space space and was launched on April It completes a full orbit of Earth every minutes That means it travels at miles per second If you were going this speed on Earth you would be able to get from New York to San Francisco in minutes The Hubble itself is the size of a large school bus but still small enough to fit inside the cargo bay of a Space Shuttle It was repaired in due to problems in the picture quality
