 Hermann Joseph Muller generally known as H J Muller was an Americans American genetics geneticist educator and Nobel Prize winner He was best known for his work on the physiological and genetic effects of radiation as well as his outspoken political beliefs Muller frequently warned of the long term dangers of radioactive fallout from nuclear explosion s Muller s life was as extraordinary as could be imagined Born in New York City he got his PhD at California Institute of Technology CalTech in Thomas Hunt Morgan Morgan s Drosophila fly lab He next worked at Rice University and then spent twelve years at the Colleges and universities in Texas University of Texas Then he moved to Berlin in then to Leningrad and then to Moscow In all these places he organised a genetics lab and sometimes taught as well Then arose the scientific charlatan Lysenko who saw to it that genuine genetics scientists came under the disapproval of Stalin Once again Muller moved this time to Edinburgh with strains of Drosophila then finally back to the United States in where he became an advisor to the Manhattan Project He became Professor of Zoology at Indiana University Muller s Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in was for the discovery that mutations can be induced by X ray s By then the real interest lay in the same effects caused by gamma rays from nuclear testing Muller was a wholehearted enthusiast for eugenics socialism atheism and other relatively unpopular ideas but his real contribution was to genetics One reputable source writes of him Muller s contributions dominate the s and s The variety of genetic tools he developed elevated Drosophila to an almost exclusive role in the study of the gene concept It is almost impossible to read Muller s articles during those two decades without feeling overwhelmed by the quality of genius which characterises the analytical and projective treatment of his discoveries and experiments
