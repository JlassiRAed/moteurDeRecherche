 OpenVMS is an operating system which Digital Equipment Corporation originally devleoped for their VAX server s Later it was ported and now also runs on DEC Alpha and Itanium based systems It is a bit operating system When it was published in it was one of the first of its kind OpenVMS is capable of supporting many concurrent users each user is able to run several programs at the same time It was also noe of the first operating systems with a Graphical user interface the VAXstation was a very popular workstation at the time OpenVMS uses virtual memory and was originally developed as a time sharing system time sharing batch process ing system It was made for transaction processing and is a real time computing real time system The jobs users submit can have a higher priority than those of the operating system The operating system offers high availability through Computer cluster clustering The system load can be distributed over multiple computers That way the system is disaster tolerant One machine that fails will not shut the operation down OPenVMS introduced many features that became standard in later operating systems It supported computer network s first using DECNet later using TCP IP Symmetrical multiprocessing Symmetrical Asymmetrical multiprocessing asymmetrical and NUMA multiprocessing including clustering A distributed computing distributed file system An integrated database first Record Management Services RMS later Oracle Rdb Rdb Support for different programming language s including a standardized mechanism of calls between those programming languages An extensible Shell Shell A high level of security Today OpenVMS is used in many enterorises where availability and uptime are critical These include bank s and insurance company insurance companies System up times of over a decate have been repoorted A feature called rolling upgrade allows to upgrade software or hardware without the need to shut the system down A data center that is destroyed will not lead to downtime either if the system is configured properly Customers using OpenVMS include banks and financial services hospitals and healthcare network information services and large scale industrial manufacturers of various products
