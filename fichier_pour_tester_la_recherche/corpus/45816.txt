 Radiation therapy is the use of radiation to treat diseases It is typically used in the treatment of cancer Radiation therapy may help cure several different types of cancer if they are limited to one area of the body Doctors also use it to prevent tumor recurrence after surgery to remove a primary malignant tumor Radiation therapy works together with chemotheraphy Radiation therapy has been used before during and after chemotherapy in cancers known to be affected by radiation Radiation therapy is used on tumors because of its ability to control cell growth Ionizing radiation works by damaging the DNA of exposed tissue thus killing it To spare normal tissues doctors aim weaker radiation beams from several angles of exposure to intersect at the tumor providing a much larger absorbed dose there than in the surrounding healthy tissue Besides the tumor itself the target for the radiation may also include the lymph node s that drain the area Doctors include the lymph nodes if they are clinically or radiologically involved with tumor or if there is thought to be a risk of that individual cancer cells will spread It is impossible to aim the radiation beam exactly because the tumor moves as the patient wikt breathes breathes So doctors also expect to include some healthy tissue around the tumor to make sure that the entire tumor is hit by radiation Radiation oncology is the medical specialty concerned with prescribing radiation This is different than radiology the use of radiation in medical imaging and medical diagnosis diagnosis Radiation may be prescribed by a radiation oncologist with intent to cure organs Radiation therapy can also be used in non malignant conditions such as the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia severe Graves ophthalmopathy thyroid eye disease pterygium pigmented villonodular synovitis and prevention of keloid scar growth vascular restenosis and heterotopic ossification Doctors limit the use of radiation therapy in non malignant conditions because they worry about the radiation could start new cancers med stub
