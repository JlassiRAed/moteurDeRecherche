 Empoldering is a method of reclaiming land from the sea Empoldering involves the use of polders and is also a way to control floods A polder is a piece of land in a low lying area that has been reclaimed from a body of water by building dikes and drainage canals Although empoldering is usually carried out in low lying coastal areas it can be also carried out in inland areas such as lakes and rivers It is commonly carried out in countries like the Netherlands where much of the country is below sea level and subject to flooding About one fifth of the land in the Netherlands has been reclaimed from the sea Their largest and most successful project is the Zuider Zee project Polders have distinct features Firstly they are enclosed by dikes to keep the water out The dikes also serve to protect the polder from erosion Secondly polders are continually maintained by systems of drainage canals and pumps which prevent them from becoming waterlogged and hence suitable for cultivation
