In cryptography a block cipher is a Symmetric key algorithm symmetric key cipher which operates on a groups of bit s of fixed length called blocks using an exact transformation During encryption a block cipher algorithm might take key Decryption is similar the decryption algorithm takes in this example a bit block of ciphertext together with the secret key and output the original bit block of plaintext One of the early block cipher designs was the Data Encryption Standard also using block cipher was adopted in Math stub
