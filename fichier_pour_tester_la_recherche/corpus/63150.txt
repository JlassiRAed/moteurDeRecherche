 Supply and demand is a model of microeconomics It describes how a price is formed in a market economy There are two determining factors on such a market the number of things made available called supply and the number of things consumer s want called demand Supply and demand shows how producer s and consumer s interact with each other This relationship will fix the price for a certain type of good In perfect competition the quantity demanded and the quantity supplied will be equal This will fix the price There will be economic equilibrium For normal goods and a normal market there are four basic laws that determine the change in the market if either supply or demand changes If the demand increases and the supply remains the same there will be a wikt shortage shortage This will mean the price will increase If the demand decreases and the supply remains the same there will be a wikt surplus surplus This will mean the price will go down If the supply increases and the demand remains the same there will be a surplus and the price will go down If the supply decreases and the demand remains the same there will be a shortage and the price will increase When there is more supply this will cause prices to fall because people will not want to pay more for items that can be found easily When there is more demand prices will go up because many people want to buy the same item but there is not enough supply for it When demands for new goods and services go up new markets come into being The greater the demand the faster this happens This greater number of providers makes the supply go up which forces the price down toward the cost of production and distribution
