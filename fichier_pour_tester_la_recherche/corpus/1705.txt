 Hylonomus is an extinct stem tetrapod which lived million years ago during the Pennsylvanian Cite journalThe lack of skull openings behind the eyes makes it difficult to decide whether or not it is a sauropsid Westlothiana is older but may have been an amphibian and Casineria is rather fragmentary Hylonomus was Fossils of Hylonomus have been found in the remains of fossilized club moss stumps in Joggins Fossil Cliffs Nova Scotia Canada The theory is that after harsh weather the club mosses would crash down The stumps eventually hollow out Small animals such as Hylonomus seeking shelter might enter and become trapped starving to death Fossils of the basal pelycosaur Archaeothyris and the basal diapsid Petrolacosaurus are also found in the same region of Nova Scotia higher up dated about million years later Some fossilized footprints from about mya have been found in New Brunswick They are attributed to Hylonomus
