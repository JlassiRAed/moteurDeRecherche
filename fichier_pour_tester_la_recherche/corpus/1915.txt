In chemistry a leaving group is an atom or molecule that leaves another molecule during a chemical reaction reaction This reaction can be for example a nucleophilic substitution In this case the leaving group gets a pair of electron s Some leaving groups are better than others This is because some atoms or molecules like getting extra electrons The halide s are a good example of good leaving groups The type of leaving group can change the type of reaction that happens For example bad leaving groups make an SN reaction more difficult while they make an SN reaction easier
