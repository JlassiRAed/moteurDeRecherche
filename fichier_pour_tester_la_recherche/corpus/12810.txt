An intron is a non coding sequence in a gene It is any nucleotide sequence within a gene that is removed by RNA splicing to get the final RNA product of a gene Sequences of coding DNA which are joined together in the final RNA after RNA splicing are exon s They code for amino acid s in the final polypeptide Introns are in the genes of most organisms and many viruses They can be in a wide range of genes including those that generate protein s Ribosome ribosomal RNA translation Introns parts of a gene which are discarded non working bits Exons parts of a gene which are expressed bits of a gene which code for amino acid sequences in a protein The discovery of introns led to the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in for Phillip Sharp and Richard Roberts The term intron was introduced by American biochemist Walter Gilbert cite journal
