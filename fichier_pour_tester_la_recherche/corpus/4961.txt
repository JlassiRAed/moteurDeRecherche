 Transcription factors help to gene regulation regulate genes Each transcription factor binds to a specific DNA sequence That is how they control the rate of transcription transcription of genetic information from DNA to messenger RNA Transcription factors are sometimes called a sequence specific DNA binding factor Alone or with other proteins in a complex they promote or block RNA polymerase RNA polymerase is the enzyme that transcription transcribes genetic information from DNA to RNA for specific genes cite journal The role of general initiation factors in transcription by RNA polymerase II A defining feature of transcription factors is that they have one or more DNA binding domain s which attach to specific sequences of DNA next to the genes that they regulate
