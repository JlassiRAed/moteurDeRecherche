In physics the angular velocity specifies the Angular frequency angular speed at which an object is rotation rotating along with the direction in which it is rotating It is a vector quantity The SI unit of angular velocity is radians per second But it may be measured in other units as well plane of rotation in a direction which is usually specified by the Right hand rule right hand rule
