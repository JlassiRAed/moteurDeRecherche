 Roger Wolcott Sperry was an United States American neurobiology neurobiologist and Nobel Prize winner He shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel In Sperry also received the National Medal of Science Before Sperry s experiments some research evidence seemed to indicate that areas of the cerebral cortex were largely interchangeable In his early experiments Sperry showed that the opposite was true after early development circuits of the brain are largely hardwired That is they are set with a particular function Sperry s work was on split brain research In his Nobel winning work Sperry tested ten patients who had undergone an operation developed in by William Van Wagenen a neurosurgeon in Rochester NY The surgery designed to treat epilepsy epileptics with grand mal seizures severed the corpus callosum the area of the brain used to transfer signals between the right and left hemispheres Sperry and his colleagues tested these patients with tasks that were known to be dependent on specific Cerebral hemisphere hemispheres of the brain and demonstrated that the two halves of the brain may each contain consciousness In his words each hemisphere isThis research contributed greatly to understanding how each cerebral hemisphere works Some activities such as naming objects or putting blocks together in a particular way can only be done when using one side of the brain or the other It seems the left hemisphere usually specializes in language processes and the right is dominant in visual construction tasks
