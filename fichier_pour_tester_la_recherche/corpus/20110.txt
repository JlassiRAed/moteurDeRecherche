A decompression chamber is a large container that divers can enter after they have surfaced to help their bodies return to normal atmospheric pressure It is also called a recompression chamber or hyperbaric oxygen therapy chamber When a diver returns to the surface too quickly he can suffer from decompression sickness To prevent this divers would stop at various points as they returned toward the surface to allow their bodies to adjust to the pressure change If a driver uses a chamber the diver will adjust in the chamber rather than stop at various depths underwater This eliminates many of the risks of long decompressions underwater in cold or dangerous conditions
