The first law of thermodynamics states that energy can t be created or destroyed but it can be changed The law forms the basis of the principle of conservation of energy This means that anything that uses energy is changing the energy from one kind of energy to another For example Exercise exercising changes energy from food into kinetic or Potential energy potential energy However in modern physics it is considered that there are only two types of energy mass and kinetic energy although this may not be helpful to those not familiar with more complex physics The law means that the total energy of the universe is a constant However energy can be transferred from one part of the universe to another The most common wording of the first law of thermodynamics used by scientists is
