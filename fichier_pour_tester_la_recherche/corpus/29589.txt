The term alternation of generations is used to describe a process in the life cycle of some eukaryote s It describes an alternation in forms which occurs in plant s and some protist s One form is diploid with n chromosomes the sporophyte The other form is haploid with only one set of chromosomes the gametophyte Both forms are multicellular organism multicellular In sexual reproduction organisms have a haploid phase with one set of chromosome s and a diploid phase with two sets of chromosomes In animals the body is usually diploid while the haploid stage is only the gamete s In other eukaryotes wikt alternate alternation of generations may occur It means that both the diploid and the haploid phases are multi cellular organisms The classic example is the moss es where the green plant is a haploid gametophyte and the reproductive phase is the diploid sporophyte The two forms often occur together as shown in the illustration on the right The term alternation of generations refers only to the sexual cycle organisms often have asexual reproduction as well The term should not be confused with life cycle stages in animals which may look very different but where all cells have two sets of chromosomes
