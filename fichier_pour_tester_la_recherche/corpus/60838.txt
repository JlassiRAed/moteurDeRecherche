Many modern computer s have operating system s that permit several applications or programs to run at the same time Each running program uses one or more so called processes that s why this situation is generally known as multiprocessing At times it can happen that a process stops responding to user input the user sees when the computer stops responding to inputs or it becomes very slow Different causes can cause this scenario The most frequent are deadlock race condition s or the system simply having too much to do In many cases the only solution is to terminate the processes which cause so much load Many Graphical User Interface GUI based operating systems have programs that allow the user to tell the operating system to terminate a process There may also be command line programs that do this When the operating system terminates a process all unsaved data of the process will be lost In the case where the operating system detects such a situation it may show a BSoD
