 Hamitic theory is a theory that claims that so called hamitic race race is superior to the negroid races on the African continent John Hanning Speke started the theory Karl Richard Lepsius and Carl Meinhof extended the theory they used language s to classify people into hamitic or non hamitic this is no longer done today Another way they classified people into hamitic or non hamitic is by ethnic roots For example a person who has ancestry from Rome would be considered closer to a Hamite than a person who s ancestry is in Africa This theory also included giving classes to those members of the negroid races of Africa upon colonization This in part contributed to the Rwandan Genocide which pinned the members of the Tutsi ethnicity or tribe against the members of the Hutu people although the tension between them was over small differences
