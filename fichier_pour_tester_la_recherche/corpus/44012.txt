The Tollund Man is the name for a mummy which was found in Denmark in the s The man lived in the th century BC in what is known as the Pre Roman Iron Age The head and face were so well preserved that he was mistaken at the time of discovery for a recent murder victim Below the body was a thin layer of moss Scientists know that this moss was formed in Danish peat bogs in the early Iron Age therefore the body was suspected to have been placed in the bog more than years ago during the early Iron Age The acid in the peat along with the lack of oxygen underneath the surface had preserved the delicate soft tissues of his body Examinations and X ray s showed that the man s head was undamaged and his heart lungs and liver were well preserved The Silkeborg Museum estimated that he must have been approximately years old and about tall at the time of his death This means he was relatively small even for the time It is likely that the body had shrunk in the bog On the first autopsy report in doctors concluded that Tollund Man died by hanging rather than strangulation The stomach and intestines were examined and tests carried out on their contents The scientists discovered that the man slast meal had been a kind of porridge made from vegetables and seeds both cultivated and wild barley linseed gold of pleasure knotweed bristlegrass and chamomile There were no traces of meat in the man s digestive system and from the stage of digestion it was apparent that the man had lived for to hours after this last meal In other words he may not have eaten for up to a day before his death Although similar vegetable soups were not unusual for people of this time two interesting things were noted The soup contained many different kinds of wild and cultivated seeds Because these seeds were not readily available it is likely that some of them were gathered deliberately for a special occasion The soup was made from seeds only available near the spring where he was found Bog bodies dry up and decompose rapidly when they are taken out of the bog Because of the facial expression and the general state of the head the decision was taken to expose the body At the time the head was preserved using Polyethylene glycol the only material available This method did not permit to preserve the body it dried up and decayed Today the head is attached to a copy of the body Both feet and the right thumb were also in a good state of preservation when the body was found in the s For this reason they were kept in formaldehyde for analysis later In the Denmark Danish Police Force made a finger print analysis making Tollund Man s thumb print one of the oldest finger prints on record Tollund Man is exposed in the Silkeborg Museum
