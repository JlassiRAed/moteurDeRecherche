 Statistical process control SPC relies on quantitative and graphic analysis of measurements to evaluate observed variation If the attributes of interest vary within an acceptable range a process is said to be in control in statistical control or stable When unacceptable variation is noted actions are typically taken to determine and correct their cause In the bottling example suppose too many bottles are filled with less than grams Checking the plant equipment reveals that one of ten filler valves is malfunctioning SPC has had broad application in manufacturing since its introduction in the s and in many other kinds of repetitive activities Much of the power of SPC lies in the ability to examine a process for the sources of variation in that process by using tools which give weight to objective analysis over subjective opinions and which allow the strength of each source to be determined numerically Variations in the process which might affect the quality of the end product or service can be detected and corrected thus reducing waste as well as the likelihood that problems will be passed on to the customer With its emphasis on early detection and prevention of problems SPC has a distinct advantage over other quality methods such as inspection which apply resources to detecting and correcting problems after they have occurred In addition to reducing waste SPC can lead to a reduction in the time required to produce the product or service from end to end This is partially due to a reduced likelihood that the final product will have to be reworked but it may also result from using SPC data to identify bottlenecks wait times and other sources of delays within the process Process cycle time reductions coupled with improvements in yield have made SPC a valuable tool from both a cost reduction and a customer satisfaction standpoint
