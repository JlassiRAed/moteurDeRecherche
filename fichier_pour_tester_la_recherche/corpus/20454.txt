 Redonda is a very small Caribbean island It is part of Antigua and Barbuda No people live here This small island is southwest of Antigua It is between the islands of Nevis and Montserrat Redonda seems like one very large rock It is what is left of an ancient volcanic core The land rises very steeply from sea level mostly as sheer cliffs There is no source of freshwater except rain The only animals that live here are seabirds and a herd of feral goats The goats live on the poor grazing on top of the island
