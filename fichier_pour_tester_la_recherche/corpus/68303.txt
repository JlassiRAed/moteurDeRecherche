In cryptography the XSL attack is a method of cryptanalysis for block cipher s The attack was first published in by research ers Nicolas Courtois and Josef Pieprzyk It was claimed that it may break the Advanced Encryption Standard cipher faster than a brute force attack Advanced Encryption Standard AES is already widely used in commerce and government for the transmission of secret and classified information Finding a technique that can decrease the amount of time it takes to break the Ciphertext secret message without having the Key key could cause wide damage In it was shown by one of the Cryptanalysis cryptanalysts that the algorithm does not perform as described in its published paper In addition the method requires long effort Unless shortened the technique does not reduce the effort to break AES in comparison to a brute force attack Therefore it does not affect the real world security of block cipher s in the near future However the attack has caused some experts to insert complexities in the algebraic simplicity of the current AES The XSL attack relies on first analyzing the internal design of a cipher then deriving a system of quadratic polynomial quadratic simultaneous equation s These systems of equation s are typically very large for example equations with variable s for the bit AES Several methods for solving such systems are known In the XSL attack a specialized algorithm termed XSL key The attack is well known and famous for requiring only a handful of Known plaintext attack known plaintexts to perform Previous methods of cryptanalysis such as Linear cryptanalysis linear and differential cryptanalysis often require unrealistically large numbers of known or Chosen plaintext attack chosen plaintext s which make them impossible to realize
