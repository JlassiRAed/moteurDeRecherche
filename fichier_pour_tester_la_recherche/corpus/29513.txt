 Synthetic genomics is a type of genetic engineering It makes genes which never occur in nature Synthetic genomics does not use naturally occurring genes It may use custom designed base pair series In the future it might use genetic code s that are not composed of the base pair two base pairs of DNA currently used by life forms The development of synthetic genomics uses technical abilities and technologies in the field of genetics Researchers can make long base pair chains cheaply and accurately on a large scale This allows them to do experiments on genomes which do not exist in nature They also use ideas in protein folding and high end computing facilities The Craig Venter J Craig Venter Institute has assembled a quasi synthetic Mycoplasma genitalium bacterial genome by recombination of overlapping fragments in a single step The use of yeast recombination greatly simplifies the assembly of large DNA molecules from both synthetic and natural fragments Other companies including one called Synthetic Genomics have been formed to take advantage of the many commercial uses of custom designed genomes
