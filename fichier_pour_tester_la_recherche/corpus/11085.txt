 Liquid scintillation counting is an analytical technique It is used to measure radiation from beta particles emitted from the sample transfer energy to the solvent molecules The molecules in turn transfer their energy to the fluors The excited fluor molecules dissipate the energy by emitting light Scintillation cocktails often contain additives that shift the wavelength of the emitted light It makes it more easily detected The samples are placed in small transparent vials They are loaded into a liquid scintillation counter The counter has two photomultiplier tubes They are connected in a coincidence circuit The coincidence circuit assures that genuine light pulses are counted Counting efficiencies under ideal conditions is about for tritium Tritium is a low energy beta emitter It is nearly for phosphorus Phosphorus is a high energy beta emitter Some chemical compounds and highly colored samples can interfere with the counting process This interference is known as quenching It can be overcome through data correction or through careful sample preparation P can also be counted in a scintillation counter without the cocktail This technique is known as Cherenkov counting It relies on the Cherenkov radiation being detected directly by the photomultiplier tubes Cherenkov counting in this experimental context is normally used for quick rough measurements
