A solvent is a substance that becomes a solution by wikt dissolve dissolving a solid liquid or gas eous Solvation solute A solvent is usually a liquid but can also be a solid or gas The most common solvent in everyday life is water Most other commonly used solvents are organic chemistry organic chemicals These are called organic solvents Solvents usually have a low boiling point and evaporate easily or can be removed by distillation thereby leaving the dissolved substance behind Solvents should therefore not chemical reaction react chemically with the dissolved compounds they have to be inert Solvents can also be used to solvent extraction extract soluble compounds from a mixture the most common example is the brewing of coffee or tea with hot water Solvents are usually clear and colorless liquids and many have a characteristic Odor smell The concentration of a solution is the amount of compound that is dissolved in a certain volume of solvent The solubility is the maximal amount of compound that is soluble in a certain volume of solvent at a specified temperature Common uses for organic solvents are in dry cleaning and in chemical syntheses Inorganic solvents are used in research chemistry and in a few technological processes
