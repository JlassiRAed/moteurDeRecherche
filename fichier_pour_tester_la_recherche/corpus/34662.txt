 Harpsichords are keyboard instruments that make sound by having the strings plucked with a plectrum They are thought to have originated when a keyboard was attached to a psaltery This makes them different from a clavichord where the strings are hit The piano is therefore closer to a clavichord than a harpsichord On a piano it is possible to play louder or quieter by playing the keys with more or less force On a harpsichord the volume accompaniment more quietly on the other Some small harpsichords were called virginals perhaps because they were played by young girls There are also spinet s which were very small and sometimes wing shaped They could be picked up and put on a table Harpsichords were very important in music from the Renaissance and Baroque music Baroque periods They were used as solo instruments as well as to accompany an orchestra Some of the most famous composers of harpsichord music are William Byrd
