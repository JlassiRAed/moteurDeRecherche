A destructive cult is a cult or other religious movement which has caused harm to its members or other people or which will likely do so There is a discussion of what harm really means in this context For most researchers it includes physical harm so organisations who injure or kill their members qualify Some researchers also include mental abuse in this notion of harm for example A destructive cult is a pyramid shaped authoritarian regime with a person or group of people that have dictatorial control It uses deception in recruiting new members e g people are NOT told up front what the group is what the group actually believes and what will be expected of them if they become members The use of the term destructive cult has also been criticised According to some researchers the term has been used to describe groups which are not necessarily harmful to themselves or others The term may be used too widely and equated with the deaths of members of Peoples Temple at Jonestown The German Federal Constitutional Court ruled in that the German government defamation defamed the Osho movement by referring to it among other things as a destructive cult The court decided that destructive cult and other expressions employed by the government to describe the group had no factual basis to justify their use
