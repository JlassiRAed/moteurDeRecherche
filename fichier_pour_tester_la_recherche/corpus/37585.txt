The Great Oxygenation Event Earth s oxygen a mystery easy to take for granted New York Times Retrieved October Photosynthesis was producing oxygen both before and after the GOE The difference was that before the GOE organic matter and dissolved iron chemically captured any free oxygen Dissolved iron rock from the Archaean and Proterozoic era s The GOE was the point when these minerals became saturated and could not capture any more oxygen The excess free oxygen started to accumulate in the atmosphere Red and green lines represent the range of the estimates while time is measured in billions of years ago in the atmosphere produced but absorbed in oceans seabed rock starts to gas out of the oceans but is absorbed by land surfaces Oxygen was toxic to most of the Earth s anaerobic organism anaerobic inhabitants at the time As cyanobacteria produced oxygen and built their stromatolite s they changed the environment for other protist s Since the other protists had no way to deal with oxygen most would have become extinct Another consequence was the effect of free oxygen on atmospheric methane a greenhouse gas The reaction removed the methane and caused the Huronian glaciation possibly the longest snowball Earth episode ever Free oxygen has been an important part of the atmosphere ever since
