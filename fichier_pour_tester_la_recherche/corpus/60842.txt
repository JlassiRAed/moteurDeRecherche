In many domains of science measurement s are done If these measurements are drawn in a graph they will be shown as simple unconnected points Such data are called data points or Discrete mathematics discrete Handling and analysis of the data is easier if it can be described using a continuous function or a line connecting the discrete data point together In order to do this the line between two measurements or data points need to be created This process of connecting the data points together with a line called interpolation There are different ways to invent the data such as simply drawing a straight line between two data points which is not very accurate or using polynomial s to create a more accurate representation In many cases the results of this interpolation are usable either as a replacement for missing data points or as a tool to help understand more complicated data Interpolation tries to find the values between two known points of data It is not to be confused with extrapolation which is a similar process that tries to find data points at the edge or outside the currently defined points
