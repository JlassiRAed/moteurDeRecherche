There are a numbers of ways to calculate square root s of number s and even more ways to Estimation estimate them The mathematical operation of finding a root is the opposite operation of exponentiation and therefore involves a similar but reverse thought process Firstly one needs to know how Arithmetic precision precise the result is expected to be This is because often square root s are Irrational numbers irrational For example square root of a nice round whole number is a Fraction fraction which in its Decimal places decimal notation has Infinity infinite length and therefore it is impossible to express it exactly Moreover for some real number s the square root is a complex number For example square root of is a complex number imaginary unit i In many cases there may be multiple valid answers For example square root of is but is also a valid answer One can verify that they are both valid answers by squaring each candidate answer and checking if you obtain as the result of verification Please note that calculating a square root is a special case of the problem of Nth root calculating N root
