 Bioleaching is getting metals from their ore s by using living organism s This is much cleaner than the traditional method using cyanide Bioleaching is one of several methods used to recover copper zinc lead arsenic antimony nickel molybdenum gold silver and cobalt Bioleaching uses certain types of bacteria to produce a solution called a leachate By leaving these bacteria with a low grade metal ore they can produce leachates which have a compound of that metal Because this is in a solution it can be used in electrolysis to make the pure metal This only produces small amounts each time and is repeated to make it economically viable
