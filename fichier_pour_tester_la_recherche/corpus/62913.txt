 Nuclear pore Rough endoplasmic reticulum Smooth endoplasmic reticulum Ribosome on the rough ER Protein s that are transported Transport Vesicle vesicle Golgi apparatus Cis face of the Golgi apparatus Trans face of the Golgi apparatus Cisternae of the Golgi apparatus Endoplasmic reticulum is a cellular organelle It is the transport network for molecules going to specific places as compared to molecules that float freely in the cytoplasm The endoplasmic reticulum is in cells that have a nucleus in eukaryote cells but not in prokaryote cells It takes these forms Rough endoplasmic reticulum so called because it is studded with ribosome s and secretes protein s into the cytoplasm Smooth endoplasmic reticulum Among its functions is the production of proteins and steroids the maintenance of Membrane Plasma Membranes plasma membranes and a pathway for molecules to move along Similar to the ER is the sarcoplasmic reticulum found only in muscle cells The SR stores and pumps calcium ion s The SR contains large stores of calcium which it releases when the muscle cell is stimulated Another type of cytoplasmic network is the plate like Golgi apparatus The lacey membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum were first seen in by scientists using an electron microscope
