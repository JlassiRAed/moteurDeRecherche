The Montevideo Convention on the Rights and Duties of States is a treaty Today it is part of customary international law The treaty was signed at Montevideo Uruguay on December at the Seventh International Conference of American States At this conference United States President Franklin D Roosevelt and United States Secretary of State Secretary of State Cordell Hull declared the so called Good Neighbor Policy which opposed U S armed intervention in inter American affairs Franklin D Roosevelt tried to reverse the perception of Yankee imperialism with this treaty The view of Yankee imperialism was brought about by policies instituted The convention is about what is a state and what rights and duties it has Most well known is article which sets out the four criteria for statehood that have sometimes been recognized as an accurate statement of customary international law The state as a person of international law should possess the following qualifications capacity to enter into relations with the other states In addition the first sentence of article explicitly states that The political existence of the state is independent of recognition by the other states This is known as the declarative theory of statehood Some have questioned whether these criteria are sufficient as they allow less recognized entities like the Republic of China Republic of China or even entirely non recognized entities like the Principality of Sealand to claim full status as states According to the alternative constitutive theory of statehood a state exists only insofar as it is recognized by other states It should not be confused with the recognition of states approach Estrada doctrine There have also been attempts to further broaden the convention s definition although they have gained less support Founders of non territorial micronation s commonly assert that the requirement in the Montevideo Convention of a defined territory is in some way wrong headed for largely unspecified reasons Some non territorial entities notably the Sovereign Military Order of Malta are indeed considered subjects of international law but these do not aspire to statehood
