In cryptography RC is a symmetric key algorithm symmetric key block cipher derived from RC RC is a parameter ized algorithm with a variable Block size block size a variable key size and a variable number of rounds RC stands for Rivest Cipher or alternatively Ron s Code In the National Institute of Standards and Technology NIST announced a competition to choose a successor to Data Encryption Standard competition but was not selected as a standard In order to provide varieties of security and efficiency levels RC allows choices for the block size The number of rounds can range from to while the key size s can range from bits to bit s in size cite webRC is very similar to RC in structure and could be viewed as interweaving two parallel RC encryption processes However RC does use an extra multiplication operation not present in RC and the use of four b bit working registers bit blocks so four working registers are required to build the AES architecture using only bit operations RC is a proprietary and patent ed algorithm and may require licensing and royalty payments for any products using the algorithm It was designed by Ron Rivest Matt Robshaw Ray Sidney and Yiqun Lisa Yin and was also submitted to the NESSIE and CRYPTREC projects
