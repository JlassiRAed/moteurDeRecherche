A byte is a unit of measurement of the size of information on a computer or other Electronics electronic device A single typed character Bytes are often represented by the letter B Historically bytes have been used to encode text characters Most of the time this was done using eight bits per byte but other numbers of bits were also used To describe the byte that uses bits computer scientists talk about octet EBCDIC is a character encoding used mainly on mainframe computer mainframe computers that uses bits per byte ASCII is another encoding that uses only seven bits When used as a measurement the byte is basically measuring how many numbers a computer is usually measured in bits not bytes One byte is usually equal to eight bit s Some very early computers had bytes with different numbers of bits An Octet octet is always eight bits In modern usage an octet and a byte are the same
