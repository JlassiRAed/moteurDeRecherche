 Phase shift keying is a way of transmitting information This is done by modulation modulating the phase of a carrier wave In such a system the amplitude of the wave does not carry any information all information is present in the phase of the signal In many cases this allows to better use the bandwidth available If we think of a wave as a wiggly line wiggling a specific amount of times a second and we can change at which part of the wiggle it is in Say if it is at the top of its wiggle and we immediately change it to the bottom of its wiggle this is called a phase shift We can use that change to carry information By either changing or not changing the wave every time it gets to the top of its wiggle we can send either ones or zeros This is called Binary Phase Shift Keying If we change the phase of the wave as it reaches the top we can have this represent a If we don t change it at the top we can have this represent a We can use a computer and a radio to turn text into a wave like this and then send it A radio and a computer listening to this wave changing or not changing can figure out the original message being sent and turn it back into text Binary Phase Shift Keying can be used to send computer data across radio waves quite efficiently Certain Wireless LAN standards use Phase shift keying which they sometimes couple with Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing to get higher data rates
