 Interstellar space travel is manned or unmanned travel between star s Interstellar travel is much more difficult than travel within the Solar System though travel in starship s is a staple of science fiction Actually there is no suitable technology at present Given sufficient travel time and engineering work both unmanned and sleeper ship interstellar travel seem possible Both present considerable technological and economic challenges which are unlikely to be met in the near future particularly for manned probes NASA ESA and other space agencies have done research into these topics for several years and have worked out some theoretical approaches Energy requirements appear to make interstellar travel impractical for generation ships but less so for heavily shielded sleeper ships
