 The Radiata is a super phylum which includes both the echinoderm s and the ctenophore s It is not part of the usual classification system and is not used by all biologists The group includes the Symmetry Radial symmetry radially symmetric animals of the Eumetazoa The echinoderms however are members of the Bilateria because they exhibit bilateral symmetry in their developing stages Their radial symmetry is secondary Thomas Cavalier Smith in defined a subkingdom called Radiata consisting of the Phylum phyla sea sponge Porifera Myxozoa Trichoplax Placozoa Cnidaria and Ctenophora in Radiata that is all the animals that are not in Bilateria The Kingdom Five kingdoms Five Kingdom classification of Lynn Margulis and K V Schwartz keeps only Cnidaria and Ctenophora in Radiata Clade Cladistic classifications do not recognize Radiata as a clade The radiata in this sense are diploblastic meaning they have two primary germ layers endoderm and ectoderm Cavalier Smith s use of the term Radiata includes animals with a single germ layer such as sponges Although radial symmetry is usually given as a defining characteristic of radiates a few members of the class Anthozoa which are now considered as the most basal and oldest group of cnidarians are actually bilaterally symmetric Newer research strongly indicates that bilateral symmetry evolved before the split between Cnidaria and Bilateria the radially symmetrical cnidarians have evolved radial symmetry secondarily This means the bilaterism in species like N vectensis has a primary origin Also the free swimming planula larvae of cnidarians exhibit bilateral symmetry Ctenophores show biradial symmetry
