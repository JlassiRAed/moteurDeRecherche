An epiphyte is a plant which grows on another plant without being a parasite The term is also be used for bacteria fungi lichen s and moss es which grow on plants However most epiphytes are flowering plant s and about a third of all fern s are epiphytes An epiphyte gets its moisture and nutrients from the air and rain and sometimes from debris accumulating around it The ones in the temperate zone are often mosses liverwort s lichens and algae and in the tropics ferns cacti orchid s and bromeliad s Sometimes such plants are called air plants because they do not root in soil This is misleading though as there are many aquatic epiphytes as well Epiphytic organisms only take support from the host they are usually not parasite s Parasitic and semi parasitic plants like the mistletoe are not true epiphytes Epiphytes usually use photosynthesis to get energy often they have adapted their leaf leaves to be able to capture rain water if they are not aquatic Epiphytes are important for other species too certain frog s live in the water reservoir of epiphytes
