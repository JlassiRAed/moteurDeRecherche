A buffer solution is chemical solution which resists change to its pH or acidity It is a solution in water of a mixture of a weak acid or Base base and its salt The pH of the solution changes very little when a small amount of strong acid or base is added to it Buffer solutions are used as a means of keeping pH at a nearly constant value in a wide variety of chemical applications Many life forms have a relatively small pH range an example of a buffer solution is blood Buffer solutions may be of two types acidic and basic Acidic A solution of a weak acid and its salt Basic A solution of a weak base and its salt If you add acid to the solution the concentration of H ions will increase to keep equilibrium a small number of ions will be combined and so a small amount of salt will break into ions and maintain the pH
