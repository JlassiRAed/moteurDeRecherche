 Fulgurites are a rare type of natural glass made when lightning hits silica rich minerals that are commonly in sand soil and some Rock rocks Tubular fulgurites are found in places with a lot of silica like beaches or deserts Lightning makes a tubular fulgurite when a bolt goes through the sand and melts silica into a liquid The liquid silica cools and hardens quickly leaving behind a thin glassy tube usually with a rough outer surface and a smooth inner surface Underground a fulgurite may be shaped like the roots of a tree branch ing out with many arms that trace the zigzagging path of the lightning bolt They are quite delicate with walls no thicker than mm Some of the largest fulgurites are removed from the ground in many pieces and then glued back into their original shape
