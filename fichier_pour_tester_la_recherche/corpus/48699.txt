 Chi squared test is a statistical hypothesis test It usually tests the hypothesis that the experimental data does not differ from untreated data That is a null hypothesis The distribution of the test statistic is a chi squared distribution when the null hypothesis is true The test results are regarded as significant if there is only one chance in that the result could be got by chance There are three main groups of tests Tests for distribution check that the values follow a given probability distribution Tests for independence check that the values are Independence independent if this is the case no value can be left out without losing information Tests for homogeneity These check that all samples taken have the same probability distribution or are from the same set of values
