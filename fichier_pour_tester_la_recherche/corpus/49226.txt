The guppy Like all other members of the family it is live bearing Guppies are popular aquarium kept fish because of their inexpensive needs and beautiful color ranges Guppies like all fish have gill s The heart of a guppy is very different from that of a mammal for instance there are two compartments instead of four They are called the auricle and ventricle When the fish breaths the ventricle contracts and blood is forced out to the gills which act as lungs This is where the gas exchange happens The blood receives oxygen and releases carbon dioxide The blood that now carries oxygen goes through the dorsal artery which divides into smaller and smaller vessels and go all over the body to then distribute the oxygen and gets carbon dioxide and waste Then the blood is carried to the heart by veins and lymph vessels Then the cycle repeats over and over A guppy s nervous system is highly centralized around its spinal cord and brain The cerebellum controls the body s movements and the olfactory bulbs and cerebrum control s it s sense of smell
