A superconductor is a special type of material that conduction conducts electricity without resistance That means that electron electrons can flow very easily through the material This can be achieved only at very low temperature temperatures The critical temperature at which a material becomes superconducting varies from material to material Most materials are not superconductors Another property of superconductors is the Magnetic flux Flux Trapping Effect which can cause a rare earth element rare earth magnet to float above a cooled superconductor
