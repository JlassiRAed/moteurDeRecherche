 Differential cryptanalysis is a general form of cryptanalysis applicable to block cipher s but also can be applied to stream cipher s and cryptographic hash function s It is the study of how differences in the input can affect the resultant differences at the output In the case of a block cipher it refers to a set of techniques and methods for tracing differences through the network of transformations discovering where the cipher demonstrates Random non random behaviour and extend such properties to recover the secret key key Differential cryptanalysis attacks are usually Chosen plaintext attack chosen plaintext attacks meaning that the attacker must be able to obtain encrypted Encryption ciphertexts for some set of plaintext s of his choosing
