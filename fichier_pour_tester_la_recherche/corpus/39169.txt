 Fluid Dynamics talks about how fluids work It is one of the oldest parts of the study of Physics and is studied by physicists mathematicians and engineers Mathematics can describe how fluids move using mathematical formulas called equation s The fluid dynamics of gases are called aerodynamics Understanding how fluids behave helps us understand things like flight or ocean currents For example fluid dynamics can be used to understand weather because clouds and air are both fluids Fluid dynamics can also be used to understand how aeroplane s fly through the air or how ship s and submarine s move through water Computer programs can use the mathematical equations of fluid dynamics to model and predict the actions of moving fluids Computers have helped us understand fluid dynamics very much and some people study how to model or simulate fluids only with a computer Studying how fluid dynamics can be done with computers is called computational fluid dynamics
