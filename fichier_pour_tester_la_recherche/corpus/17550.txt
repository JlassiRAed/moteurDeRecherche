An accretion disc is an Astronomy astronomical term It describes a disc of material being drawn in by gravity to a centre of mass such as a star or black hole As the material comes in it spins round the central body and Electromagnetic radiation radiates energy The central body is typically either a young star a protostar a white dwarf a neutron star or a black hole As the material moves in gravitational energy released in that process is transformed into heat and rotation al movement The energy emitted at the disk surface is in form of electromagnetic radiation The frequency range of that radiation depends on the central object Accretion discs of young stars and protostars radiate in the infrared those around neutron stars and black holes in the X ray part of the spectrum
