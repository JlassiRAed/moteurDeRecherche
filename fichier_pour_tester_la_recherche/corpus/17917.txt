 Rust is a type of corrosion It happens to iron and its alloys when it is wikt exposed exposed to air or water for a long time Rust slowly wikt decompose decomposes iron into other chemicals because of a chemical reaction reaction with the oxygen molecule molecules Both air and water are needed for rust Almost all metals corrode but they can be protected by covering with paint a coating of oil or grease or even plastic Sacrificial protection or industrial galvanizing can also work Alloy s such as stainless steel rust more slowly than pure iron When iron rusts it becomes red or brown and the metal eventually wikt decay decays Rust appears on metal if it is left outside in the humidity damp air For example rust occurs mostly in cracks of alloys or metals Rain water can enter the cracks and stay in the cracks and cause the metal to corrosino corrode Eventually it becomes rust Iron is not strong after it rusts Some metals such as aluminium titanium and stainless steel form a very thin wikt coat coating of tough corrosion on the metal The metal cannot continue corroding because the coating isolates the rest of the metal from the source of oxygen This is why aluminium keeps its wikt shine shine It also makes aluminium seem very chemical reaction unreactive even though it can react with water Some types of basidiomycete fungi can be wikt mistake mistaken for rust because they are similar to rust in color and texture and sometimes are on metals
