A convergent boundary is where two or more tectonic plate s collide with each other causing massive earth movements The Himalayas were formed by such a collision Earthquake s and volcano es are common near convergent boundaries This is because of pressure friction and plate material melting in the Mantle mantle align center The diagram illustrates some differences between the two types of subduction Oceanic crust moves under A deep ocean trench forms at the coast and an arc of mountainous volcanoes forms inland Seen along the western edge of the Americas Continental crust moves under The edge of the continental plate folds into a huge mountain range Behind it is a high plateau The Himalayas and the Tibetan plateau are a perfect example of this
