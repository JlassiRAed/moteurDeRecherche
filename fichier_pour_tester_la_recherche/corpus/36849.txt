 Booing means shouting BOO If people shout boo after a performance Booing and hissing used to be very common especially at the opera In the early days of opera opera audiences often behaved badly They went to the opera to chat with their friends to cheer their favorite singers and to boo the singers they did not like not to listen carefully to the music Booing has recently become less common in Western culture except at sports events because people think it is rude Audience s today are more likely simply not to clap if they do not like a performance Slow hand clapping is also a way of showing sarcastic applause
