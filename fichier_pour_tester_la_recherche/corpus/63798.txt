In chemistry the term inert is used to describe something that is not chemically active The noble gas es were described as being inert because they did not Chemical reaction react with the other chemical element elements or themselves Inert gases are completely inert to basic chemical reaction s because their outer electron shell valence shell is completely filled with electrons With a filled outer valence shell an inert atom is not able to acquire or lose an electron and is therefore not able to participate in any chemical reactions For inert atoms or molecules a lot of energy is involved before it can combine with other elements to form compounds A high temperature and pressure is necessary and sometimes requires the presence of a catalyst For example Nitrogen elemental nitrogen is inert under standard room conditions and exists as a diatomic molecule N molecule Inert atmospheres of gases such as dinitrogen and argon are routinely used in chemical reactions where air sensitive and water sensitive compounds are handled
