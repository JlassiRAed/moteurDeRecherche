 Extra conversion data used by Module Convert Module Convert data defines all units and is transcluded in all pages where Module Convert is used Testing new units by editing that module would invalidate the cache for all affected pages For quick changes and experiments with new units this module can be edited Since this module is transcluded in only a small number of pages changes should cause little server overhead and should propagate quickly If a unit is defined in the data module any definition here is ignored so defining the same unit in both modules is not an error A unit defined here can refer to units that are also defined here and can refer to units defined in the data module Periodically those extra units that are wanted permanently can be removed from here after being added to Module Convert data local extra units return extra units extra units
