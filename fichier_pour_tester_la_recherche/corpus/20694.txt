EphemeropteroideaOdonatoptera Palaeodictyopteroidea The Palaeoptera is the group of primitive The Palaeoptera may not be monophyletic the issue is not yet settled On the other hand the Neoptera definitely are monophyletic The absence of wing folding does not necessarily mean the Palaeoptera form a natural group They may just be a group of insects that are not Neoptera in other words a wastebasket taxon As it stands the relationship of the two living Paleopteran groups to the Neoptera is unclear Probably the concept of Palaeoptera will be changed to better reflect insect evolution In any case three main palaeopteran lineages traditionally treated as superorder s are recognized Of these the Palaeodictyopteroidea themselves might also be a paraphyletic assemblage of very basal Pterygota
