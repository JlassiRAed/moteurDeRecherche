 Interstate is a Since I is north of Interstate it breaks the rules for Interstate numbering This happened because when Interstate N was renumbered to Interstate in Interstate became north of Interstate The renumbering was part of a project to remove Interstates that have letters within their numbers The highway goes over Selah Creek on a bridge called the Fred G Redmon Bridge When this bridge was opened on November it was the longest concrete arch bridge in North America In the state of Oregon wanted to make Interstate longer They planned three different roads but all of them were not chosen
