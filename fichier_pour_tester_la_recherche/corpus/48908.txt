An anaerobic organism is any organism living thing that does not need oxygen for growth Microaerophile s are organisms that may use oxygen but only at low concentrations Nanaerobe s are organisms that cannot grow in the presence of micromolar concentrations of oxygen but can grow with and benefit from nanomolar concentrations of oxygen Obligate anaerobes may use fermentation or anaerobic respiration In the presence of oxygen facultative anaerobes use aerobic respiration without oxygen some of them ferment some use anaerobic respiration Aerotolerant organisms are strictly fermentative Microaerophiles carry out aerobic respiration and some of them can also do anaerobic respiration Some anaerobic bacteria produce toxin s that are highly dangerous to higher organisms including humans
