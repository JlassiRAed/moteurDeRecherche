 Pressure means how much something is pushing on something else It is expressed as Force force per unit area P F A In technology pressure is often specified in multiples of atmospheric pressure It can also be defined as the thrust compressive force acting perpendicularly to the surface of a body acting per unit area Since pressure depends on both force and area the same amount of force applied by a hand will make less pressure than when applied by something smaller like a finger Pressure is also related to density By the ideal gas law for example doubling the pressure can put twice as much gas in a bottle To measure the amount of pressure people use these Unit of measurement units Atmosphere atm Normal atmospheric pressure is called atmosphere atm psi torr
