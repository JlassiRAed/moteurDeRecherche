 Computer network Computer networks route data packets between a source and a destination In most cases the source of a packet is not directly attached to the destination the packet needs to travel through other stations in between the two Each time a packet travels through a router or a gateway it takes one hop To prevent network congestion the maximum number of hops a packet can take is limited With IPv this count is known as time to live with IPv it is called hop count Each time the packet takes one hop the count is Wikt reduce decremented When it reaches zero the packet is Wikt discard discarded if it has not reached its destination
