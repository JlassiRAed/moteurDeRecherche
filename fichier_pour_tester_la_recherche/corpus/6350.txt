 Scalars are simple number s They are used for measurement measuring things Many things can be measured and the measure can be explained by only giving the number Suppose we are measuring a rod We could give the measured length as metre s or cm etc depending on the length of the rod under observation Here only the figure or along with the unit of measure is enough to transmit information about the rod Other examples of scalars are Unit of mass Unit of measuring luminosity Unit of length i e mass is measured by scalars distance s are measured by scalars The other family of measurement falls under the category of vector s
