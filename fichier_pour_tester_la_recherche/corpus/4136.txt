 Observation is an activity of an intelligent living being which senses and assimilates the knowledge of a phenomenon in its framework of previous knowledge and ideas Observation is more than the bare act of observing To perform observation a being must observe and seek to add to its knowledge Observations that come from self defining instruments are often unreliable Such observations are hard to reproduce because they may vary even with respect to the same Stimulus stimuli Thus they are not of much use in exact sciences like physics which require instruments which do not define themselves It is thus often necessary to use various engineering engineered instruments like spectrometer s oscilloscope s camera s telescope s interferometer s tape recorders thermometer s etc and tools like clocks scale that help in improving the quality and utility of the information obtained from an observation The accuracy and tremendous success of science is primarily attributed to the accuracy and Objectivity of observation of the reality that science explores
