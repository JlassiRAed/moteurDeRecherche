A semiconductor is a material that in some cases will Conduction conduct electricity but not in others By the addition of different atoms into the crystal lattice of the semiconductor it changes its conductivity by making N type semiconductor n type and P type semiconductor p type semiconductors Silicon is the most important commercial semiconductor though many others are used They can be made into transistor s which are small amplifiers Transistors are used in computers mobile phones digital audio players and many other electronic devices Like other solids the electrons in semiconductors can have energies only within certain bands between the energy of the ground state corresponding to electrons tightly bound to the Atomic nucleus atomic nuclei of the material and the free electron energy which is the energy required for an electron to escape entirely from the material
