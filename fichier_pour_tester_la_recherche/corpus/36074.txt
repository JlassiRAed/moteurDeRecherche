In mathematics a regular polytope is the generalisation of the regular polygon Like other polytope s it may have any natural number of dimension s For example a two dimensional regular polytope is a regular polygon and a three dimensional regular polytope is a regular polyhedron Like with the regular polygon there are certain kinds of symmetry symmetries Regular polytopes have regular facets and their vertex figure s are regular The simplest of the six convex regular polytope s are the pentachoron and tesseract
