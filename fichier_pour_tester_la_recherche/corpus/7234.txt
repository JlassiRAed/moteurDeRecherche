 Absolute truth is something that is true at all wikt time time s and in all wikt place place s It is something that is always true no matter what the wikt circumstance circumstance s The angles of a triangle add up to degrees These are all true by definition Very similar are the propositions of Euclid because they are proved once the axiom s are accepted One way or another these are all truths because they are logic ally true According to Martin Luther I shall never be a heretic I may err in dispute but I do not wish to decide anything finally on the other hand I am not bound by the opinions of men So if we consider ourselves to be wise individuals our concern should be to find the truth not to submit to opinions In two national surveys conducted by Barna Research one among adults and one among teenagers people were asked if they believe that there are moral absolutes that are unchanging or that moral truth is relative to the circumstances By a to margin adults said truth is always relative to the person and their situation The perspective was even more lopsided among teenagers of whom said moral truth depends on the circumstances and only of whom said moral truth is absolute Quite different are empiricism empirical truths All the findings of science are empirical they are based on evidence and might be wrong or incomplete Also we can be wrong about what we think we see or experience Of course we rely on science and our senses in practical life That does not alter the fact that absolute truth is only to be found inside a well defined logical system That kind of truth may or may not correspond to the real world It is worth remembering that we do not live in Euclidean space We live in space time
