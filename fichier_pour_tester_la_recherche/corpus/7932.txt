 Petrified wood while retaining the original structure of the wood Unlike other types of fossils which are typically impressions or compressions petrified wood is a three dimensional representation of the original organic material The petrifaction process occurs underground when wood becomes buried under sediment and is initially preserved due to a lack of oxygen which inhibits aerobic decomposition
