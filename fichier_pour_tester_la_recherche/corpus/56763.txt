 Charge conjugation describes a type of symmetry of nature To preform a charge conjugation one would exchange all particles with their corresponding antiparticles This action would create a physical system where everything would be the same except the electromagnetic charge would be reversed For example one could make an anti hydrogen atom with an anti proton and an anti electron This would result in an atom with a negatively charged Nucleus remains unchanged after charge conjugation the system is said to be symmetric with respect to charge conjugation This symmetry is also known as C symmetry
