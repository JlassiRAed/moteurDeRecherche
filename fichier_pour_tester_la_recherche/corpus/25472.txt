 Adaptive radiation is rapid evolution ary radiation It is an increase in the number and diversity of species in each lineage It produces more new species and those species live in a wider range of habitat s Some definitions phrase it in terms of a single clade Adaptive radiation is the rapid proliferation of new taxa from a single ancestral group many lines underwent rapid radiation simultaneously This must have something to do with the availability of ecological niche s and relative absence of competition The Ediacaran biota were the result of an early metazoa n radiation The greatest radiation of all took place early in the Cambrian period when most of our animal phyla evolved see List of animal phyla In the relative absence of competition groups diversify to fill available habitat s and niche s The term was introduced and discussed by George Gaylord Simpson the palaeontology palaeontologist who contributed to the modern evolutionary synthesis Others use terms like macroevolution or even megaevolution as if the processes are different from those which occur below species level It is part of evolutionary theory that all processes take place at the level of populations All agree though that the speed of evolution does change however it is measured
