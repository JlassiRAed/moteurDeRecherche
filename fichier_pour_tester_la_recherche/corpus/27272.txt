 Susumu Tonegawa He discovered the Genetics genetic mechanism that produces antibody diversity Although he won the Nobel Prize for his work in immunology Tonegawa is a molecular biology molecular biologist by training In his later years he has turned his attention to the molecule molecular and cell cellular basis of memory Tonegawa is best known for elucidating the genetic mechanism in the adaptive immune system If each antibody was coded by one gene it would take millions of genes to protect against antigens Instead as Tonegawa showed in a landmark series of experiments beginning in genetic material can rearrange itself to form the vast array of available antibodies The main mechanism is called RNA splicing Antibodies have a variable region in their structure Tonegawa compared the DNA of B cell s in embryonic and adult mouse mice He found that genes in the mature B cells of the adult mice are moved around recombined and deleted to make the many versions of the variable region of antibodies
