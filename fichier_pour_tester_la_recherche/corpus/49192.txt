In geometry the parallel postulate is one of the axiom s of Euclidean geometry Sometimes it is also called Euclid s fifth postulate because it is the fifth postulate in Euclid s Euclid s Elements Elements The postulate says that if you cut a line segment with two lines and the two interior angles the lines form add up to less than two right angles then the two lines will eventually meet if you extend them long enough The field of geometry which follows all of Euclid s axioms is called Euclidean geometry Geometries which do not follow all of Euclid s axioms are called non Euclidean geometry
