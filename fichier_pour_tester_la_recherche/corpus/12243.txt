 Gunnysacking is a metaphor used in conflict resolution which involves the act of storing up grievances acquired in the course of a relationship rather than resolve them when they first occurred The word is based on the idea of using a gunny sack storing a number of items A typical example might occur in a marriage facing occasional difficulty Partners may have small grievances or annoyances which by themselves are not critical However over time one partner gets less happy and more annoyed Then some incident occurs and a full blown argument follows By analogy this is the gunny sack bursting with an overblown reaction The term may also refer to bringing up past grievances when trying to resolve some present problem in a relationship In which case gunnysacking and presents a side track obstacle to dealing with the current issues Additionally once the practice becomes a familiar pattern used by one person in a relationship other persons may avoid reporting new issues or problems for the sake of avoiding a repeat of the gunnysacking behavior
