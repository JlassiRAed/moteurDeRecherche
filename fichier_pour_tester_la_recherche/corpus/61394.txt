The adaptive immune system is made of specialized cell s and process es which kill pathogen s or prevent their attack The adaptive immune system is switched on by the evolution arily older innate immune system This older system is non specific whereas the adaptive system is tailored to specific targets Whereas the innate immune system is found in all metazoa the adaptive system is only found in vertebrate s It is thought to have arisen in the first Gnathostomata jawed vertebrates The adaptive immune response gives the vertebrate immune system the ability to recognize and remember specific pathogens The system mounts stronger attacks each time a particular pathogen is encountered It is adaptive immunity because the body s immune system prepares itself for future challenges
