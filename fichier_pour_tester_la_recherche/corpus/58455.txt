A ribozyme is an RNA molecule that can help certain biochemical reactions similar to the action of protein enzymes Also called catalytic RNA ribozymes work in the ribosome to link amino acid s during Translation protein synthesis They also take part in RNA splicing viral replication and transfer RNA biosynthesis The discovery of ribozymes showed RNA can be both genetic material This led to the RNA world hypothesis in which RNA acts in the evolution of prebiotic self replicating systems Investigators studying the origin of life have produced ribozymes in the laboratory that can catalyze their own synthesis under certain conditions such as an RNA polymerase ribozyme Some ribozymes may play an important role as therapeutic agents as enzymes which target defined RNA sequences for cleavage as biosensor s and for applications in genomics and gene discovery
