A chemical element is a substance that contains only one type of atom If a substance contains more than one type of atom it is a chemical compound compound An element can be a solid liquid or gas The smallest particle of such an element is an atom Atoms are made up of protons neutron s and electron s Each element contains only one kind of atom The number of protons in an atom is called the atomic number For example all atoms with protons are of the chemical element carbon and all atoms with protons are of the element uranium The number of protons in the nucleus causes its electric charge This fixes the number of electrons in its normal state The electrons in their atomic orbitals determine the atom s various chemical properties Elements are the basic building blocks for all types of substances When they are combined with each other they can form molecules different chemical elements are known to modern chemistry of these elements can be found in nature The first man made element was Technetium in Chemical elements are commonly arranged in the periodic table Where the elements are on the table tells us about their properties relative to the other elements
