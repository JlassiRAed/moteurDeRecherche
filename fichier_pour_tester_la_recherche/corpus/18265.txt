The Einstein field equations or Einstein Hilbert equations or simply Einstein equations are equation s that describe gravity in the classical sense They are named after Albert Einstein and David Hilbert The basic idea is to use geometry to model the effects of gravity The usual form of the equations is that of nonlinear partial differential equation s Such equations are usually solved by approximation An exact solution can be obtained in special cases where certain assumptions are dropped or simplified
