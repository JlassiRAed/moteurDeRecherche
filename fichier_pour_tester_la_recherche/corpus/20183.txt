A photocathode is a Negative charge negatively charged electrode in a light detect ion device They are the main type of photomultiplier That means they take a little light and make more of it There are instrument s which need to magnify the amount of light coming in Examples are astronomy astronomical telescopes and military night sight equipment binoculars and telescopes on helmet s and rifle s etc The lens of the telescope or binocular passes the light onto a layer of glass coated with a special light sensitive metal When this is struck by light the absorbed energy causes electron s to jump off This is called the photoelectric effect The freed electrons are then collected to produce the final image
