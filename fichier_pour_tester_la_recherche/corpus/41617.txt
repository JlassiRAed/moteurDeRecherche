A microbial cyst is a resting or dormant stage of a microorganism usually a bacterium or a protist or rarely an invertebrate animal that helps the organism to survive in unfavorable environmental conditions It can be thought of as a state of suspended animation in which the metabolic processes of the cell are slowed down and the cell ceases all activities like feeding and locomotion Encystment also helps the microbe to spread easily from one host host to another or to a better environment When the encysted microbe reaches an environment good for its growth and survival the cyst wall breaks down by a process known as excystation Unfavorable environmental conditions trigger the making of a cyst These include the lack of nutrients or oxygen extreme temperatures lack of moisture and presence of wikt toxic toxic chemical s which are not good for the growth of the microbe
