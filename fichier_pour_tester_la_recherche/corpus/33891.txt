 SPIHT is a compression algorithm intended for compression of wavelet transform coefficients It was introduced by Amir Said and William A Pearlman in Its predecessor was Embedded zerotree wavelet EZW coding algorithm More practically SPIHT progressively transforms these coefficients into a bit stream This stream can be anywhere cut off During decoding coefficients are increasingly refined
