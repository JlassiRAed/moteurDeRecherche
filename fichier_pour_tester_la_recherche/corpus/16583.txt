 Electron crystallography is a method to determine the arrangement of atom s in solid s using a transmission electron microscope This method works in many cases where X ray crystallography does not The latter needs large D crystal s to work Protein structures are usually done from dimensional crystals polyhedron s such as Virus viral capsids or dispersed proteins Electrons can be used in these situations whereas X rays cannot because electrons interact more strongly with atoms than X rays do Electron crystallography is a method to determine the arrangement of atoms in solids using a transmission electron microscope The method was invented by Aaron Klug who won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for this and his studies on virus structures and transfer RNA in The first electron crystallographic protein structure to be solved was bacteriorhodopsin in Since then several other high resolution structures have been done by electron crystallography including the light harvesting complex Yonekura K Maki Yonekura S Namba K Complete atomic model of the bacterial flagellar filament by electron cryomicroscopy Nature pPMID
