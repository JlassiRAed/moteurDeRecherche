In Object oriented programming an object is an instance of a Class Suppose there is a bank account this bank account has a current balance but it also has a history of things that were done These fields are however not directly accessible There are methods like deposit only change this object through this interface Banks usually impose a credit limit Suppose there are dollars on the account If the client does not have a special agreement with the bank he cannot take out more money than there is on the account so he can withdraw So the withdraw method has to do a lot of checks as described above The account manager might see the account differently she might have methods to set the maximum amount that can be taken out of the account or to set the fee or interest rate that the customer has to be pay for the money borrowed As an object is an instance of a class it has certain things from that class It can perhaps be compared to other objects of that class Two apples one red and bigger the other green and smaller On the other hand It is not that easy to compare different objects A green apple does not have much in common with a steel wrench
