A complex instruction set computer The terms RISC and CISC have become less meaningful with the continued improvements of both CISC and RISC designs and implementations The first highly Instruction pipelining pipelined CISC implementations such as Intel series supports every instruction that their predecessors did but achieved high efficiency only on a few simple x subset fashion thus achieving high performance on a much larger subset of instructions Examples of CISC processors are the System VAX PDP Motorola family and Intel x architecture based processors
