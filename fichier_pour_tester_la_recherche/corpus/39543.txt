 Soft water is water which has relatively low concentration of calcium carbonate and other ions The water that lathers with soap easily is called soft water It describes type of water that contain few or no minerals like calcium ions The term is usually relative to hard water which does contain significant amounts of such ions Soft water mostly comes from peat or igneous rock sources such as granite but may also come from sandstone sources since those sedimentary rocks are usually low in calcium and magnesium Hard water may be better for the heart than soft water Its calcium ions may be a dietary supplement for some The main disadvantage of hard water is it deposits calcium carbonate on pipes especially hot water pipes This is called scale formation It may cause blockage of pipes and reduce boiler efficiency Also soap and detergents work less well in hard water These effects increase as hardness increases Section Hardness
