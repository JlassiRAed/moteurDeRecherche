 Moai are stone statues on Easter Island Each moai is made out of one large stone but some have an extra stone on top of the head Most were made from the volcano volcanic rock in the Rano Raraku area of the island Moai are sometimes called heads but they do have shoulders arms and a body but these are usually too small for the head also some of the best known ones had been partly buried over the years and only the heads were showing Most moai are between and metre s high and usually weigh tonne s There are about moai placed mainly around the coast of the island plus nearly more which were left not yet finished at Rano Raraku When why and how they were made is still a mystery today It is believed that they were made almost years ago by Polynesia ns who lived there at the time and were made to honour their ancestors and bring good luck Making the statues would have needed a lot of time and effort To move them they may have used wooden sledges or rollers or even walked them by rocking the moai along The youngest moai found was built around It is believed that around that time there began a time of cold weather little food and war between the peoples By the th century all the moai had been pushed over Today some have been restored
