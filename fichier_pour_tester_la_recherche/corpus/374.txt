A Bayesian network is a kind of graph which is used to model events that cannot be observed This can then be used for inference The graph that is used is directed and does not contain any cycles The nodes of the graph represent random variable s If two nodes are connected by an edge it has an associated probability that it will transmit from one node to the other Bayesian networks are mainly used in the field of machine learning They have been used where information needs to be classified Examples are image document or speech recognition and information retrieval It is based on Reverend Thomas Bayes discovery in the s called Bayes theorem
