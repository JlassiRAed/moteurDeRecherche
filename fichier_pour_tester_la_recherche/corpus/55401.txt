An analog or analogue signal is any wikt continuous continuous signal The difference from a digital signal is that also very small fluctuations in the signal are meaningful When one speaks of analog one often means an electricity electrical context however Classical mechanics mechanical Pneumatics pneumatic Hydraulics hydraulic and other systems may also convey analog signals An analog signal uses some property of the medium to convey the signal s information Any information may be conveyed by an analog signal often such a signal is a measured change in physical phenomena such as sound light temperature position or pressure For example in sound recording changes in air pressure strike the diaphragm of a microphone which causes related changes in a voltage or the current in an electric circuit The voltage or the current is said to be an analog of the sound See digital for a discussion of digital vs analog
