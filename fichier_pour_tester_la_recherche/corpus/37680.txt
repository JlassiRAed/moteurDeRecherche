 Billboard Billboard magazine indexes the artists on their website by a number called the artist ID Each individual artist has a single identification number through which all chart history can be tracked form inside and outside the website This number is permanent and is needed when using the templates on Wikipedia This template is very useful because if an artistid is suddenly changed all articles using the old id wouldn t need a modification to fix the problem Instead the number will be fixed on the template Also it provides a more easy use of the templates and a user who is not familiar with the Billboard website can add chart peaks on an easy way without the need of an embarrassing search for the artist ID on the website The following template compiles the artists and their respective IDs and provides the ID when called with a supported artist s name It is an incomplete list and anyone can help adding or asking missing IDs to it Editors who edit the template are requested to maintain the entries in alphabetical order If in doubt please leave a comment on the Template talk BillboardID template s talk page
