 Koyaanisqatsi is a movie It was produced and directed by Godfrey Reggio The music for the movie was composed by Philip Glass The movie is a collection of shots from a wide range of places Most of them show modern life as an unstoppable almost mechanical sequence of events The title of the movie Koyaanisqatsi comes from the Hopi Indian language and means life out of balance or crazy life The movie is designed to make us question our modern way of life and to see that the way we live now is not in balance with nature The movie shows a number of images such as the organised demolition of the Pruit Igoe housing complex the inside of a factory producing endless copies the faces of strangers in crowded streets and time lapse images of cars and other vehicles speeding along cities The effect of the music and the movie together is very powerful The movie is part of the Qatsi trilogy
