In some non technical context s or in jargon parameter may simply be a synonym for wikt criterion criterion In mathematics statistics and the mathematical science s parameters are quantities that define certain relatively constant characteristics of systems or mathematical function function s Most commonly represented theta in general form other symbols carry standard specific meanings When evaluating the function over a domain or determining the response of the system over a period of time the independent variable s are modulated while the parameters are held constant The function or system may then be reevaluated or reprocessed with different parameters to give a function or system with different behavior Loosely speaking the term parameter is used for an argument which is intermediate in status between a variable and a constant
