 Chemical bonds are what joins atom s together When two or more atoms are in a chemical bond they stay together unless the needed amount of energy or more is energy transfer transferred to the bond Something different can then happen Chemical bonds can be explained using different theory theories Some of these theories try to explain chemical bonds in a simple way that can be used by chemist s to imagine what could happen when they try to make molecule s Some explain how the atoms are bonded together with more detail and are used by chemists and physicist s There are two types of bonds covalent and ionic Covalent bonds form when atoms share electrons Ionic bonding is the attraction between oppositely charged ions Chemical bonds are negatively charged electrons that are pulling protons into each other
