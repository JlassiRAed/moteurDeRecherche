 This article is about orbital energy levels For compounds energy levels see chemical potential Simply defined as the different states of potential energy for electrons in an atom A Quantum mechanics quantum mechanical system can only be in certain state As with classical potentials the potential energy is usually set to zero at infinity leading to a negative potential energy for bound states bound electron states Energy levels are said to be degenerate if the same energy level is obtained by more than one quantum mechanical Quantum state state They are then called degenerate energy level s The following sections of this article gives an overview over the most important factors that determine the energy levels of atoms and molecules
