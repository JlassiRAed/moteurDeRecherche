User warnings are meant to guide good faith testers and dissuade bad faith vandals You may place any of the warning templates listed here on talk pages to warn users against vandalism You are responsible for making sure that the template s text is suitable to the violation If the template s tone is not appropriate do not use the template The templates are just a shortcut instead of typing If you cannot find a template that says what you want to say then just post a message for the user on his or her Wikipedia User talk page user talk page User warnings are for preventing further Wikipedia Vandalism vandalism and or Wikipedia Disruptive changing disruptive editing and not to punish users If a user stopped vandalizing some time ago and his or her edit history does not suggest a pattern of frequent vandalism there is no need to warn or block the user Likewise if a user is in the middle of an obviously bad faith vandalism spree there is no need to issue the less serious warnings or even to warn him or her before applying a temporary or a permanent block The warning templates are split into two types of warnings Single level notices single issue templates which are one off messages usually to provide information hints and tips and Multi level templates multi level warnings that can be issued with different levels of seriousness which are normally used for edits that do not meet Wikipedia s criteria or policies When issuing multi level warnings use only one warning level at a time Using several templates with different warning levels at the same time does not serve any purpose since the user will not have read the less serious warnings before you issued more serious ones
