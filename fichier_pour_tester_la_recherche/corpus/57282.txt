A magnetic field line or magnetic flux line shows the direction of a magnet s force and the strength of a magnet The idea of lines of force was invented by Michael Faraday His theory is that all of reality is made up of force itself His theory predicts that electricity light and gravity have finite propagation delays Einstein s theory agrees with this One can make magnetic field lines show as if they were physical phenomena For example iron filings placed in a magnetic field line up to form lines that correspond to field lines If there are a lot of lines through a magnet and not a great space between them the magnet is strong If the lines between a magnet are far apart and there aren t many lines the magnet is weak A way of determining the strength of a magnet is to do an experiment with iron filings The iron filings will get attracted to the magnet and move into the shape of the flux lines You then look at the shape of the iron filings and see the gap between the flux lines This gives you an idea of the strength of the magnet The use of iron filings to display a field alters the magnetic field so that it is much larger along the lines of iron This caused by the large magnetic permeability permeability of iron relative to air Magnetic fields lines are also visually displayed in Aurora polar auroras when particles cause visible streaks of light that line up with the local direction of Earth s magnetic field Magnetic field lines are like the contour line s can be stated completely and concisely using simple concepts such as the number of field lines through a surface These concepts can be quickly translated to their mathematical form Visualization of fields and the divergence and curl Notes from a course at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
