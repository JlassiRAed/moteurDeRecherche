 Germination occurs when a spore or seed starts to grow It is a term used in botany When a spore or seed germinates it produces a Plant stem shoot or seedling or a hypha The biology of spores is different from seeds A spore germinates if and when conditions are right It has a very limited lifespan The method of spore bearers which are lower plants such as moss es fern s and also fungi is to produce vast numbers of spores of which only a small percentage germinate Seeds contain an embryo a store of food Seeds can survive much longer than spores sometimes for hundreds of years The strategy of seed bearing plants is to invest energy and material in the substance of seeds and they have evolved more sophisticated methods of dispersal than just wind Seeds do not germinate until their requirements are met and these needs differ from species to species The dormancy period must be over Dormancy is governed by changes inside the seed Each species has its own dormancy period and will not germinate until that period is over Their hibernation must be over The hibernation is ended when events in the environment trigger germination Sometimes this is just temperature and water sometimes fire sometimes the seed must go through a long cold spell The requirements for fruit s is the same as for seeds A fruit is just a seed with one or more extra layers derived from parts of the flower
