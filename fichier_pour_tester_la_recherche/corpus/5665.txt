An undulator is an insertion device from high energy physics and usually part of a larger installation a synchrotron storage ring It consists of a periodic structure of dipole magnet s A static magnetic field is alternating along the length of the undulator with a wavelength Electrons traversing the periodic magnet structure are forced to undergo oscillations So the electrons give off energy as electronmagnetic radiation The radiation produced in an undulator is very intense and concentrated in narrow energy bands in the spectrum The light beam is also Collimated light collimated on the orbit plane of the electrons This radiation is guided through beamline s for experiments in various scientific areas The important dimensionless parameter where e is the particle charge B is the magnetic field is the electron rest mass and c is the speed of light characterizes the nature of the electron motion For the oscillation amplitude is bigger and the radiation contributions from each field period sum up independently leading to a broad energy spectrum When K is much bigger than the device is no longer called an undulator it is called a wiggler wiggler Physicist think about undulators both using classical physics and relativity This means that though the precision calculation is tedious the undulator can be seen as a black box An electron enters this box and an electromagnetic pulse exits through a small exit slit The slit should be small enough so that only the main cone passes so that the side lobes may be ignored Undulators can provide hundreds of time more magnetic flux than a simple bending magnet and as such are in high demand at synchrotron radiation facilities For an undulator that repeat N times the brightness can be up to The polarization of the emitted radiation can be controlled by using permanent magnets to induce different periodic electron trajectories through the undulator If the oscillations are confined to a plane the radiation will be linearly polarized If the oscillation trajectory is helical the radiation will be circularly polarized light polarized with the handedness determined by the helix If the electrons follow the Poisson distribution a partial interference leads to a linear increase in intensity In the free electron laser the intensity increases exponential growth exponentially with the number of electrons Physicists measure an undulator s effectiveness in terms of spectral radiance
