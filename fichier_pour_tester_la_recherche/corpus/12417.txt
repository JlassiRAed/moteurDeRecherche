 Instrumentation is the science that studies measurement and control over variable s Measurement and control are studied to make the maximum efficiency and safety of the work place Instrumentation includes finding the most appropriate measurement method designing and producing of the machine getting the required information and result of what has been measured by the calculation and take appropriate measures for that result Instrumentation means a lot more than measurement For example setting up the sulphur dioxide density measuring machine and getting the reading is measurement But how to use this machine which machine is to set up how many places to set up what to calculate with the reading in what situation it should sent the sign for alarm are problems handled by the instrumentation
