 Nanotechnology is a part of science and technology about the control of matter on the atom ic and molecule molecular scale this means things that are about nanometres or smaller Nanotechnology includes making products that use parts this small such as electronic devices catalysts sensors etc To give you an idea of how small that is there are more nanometres in an inch than there are inches in miles To give a international idea of how small that is there are as many nanometres in a centimetre as there are centimetres in kilometres Nanotechnology brings together scientist s and engineer s from many different subjects such as applied physics materials science interface and colloid science Semiconductor device device physics chemistry supramolecular chemistry self replicating machine s and robotics chemical engineering mechanical engineering biology biological engineering and electrical engineering Generally when people talk about nanotechnology they mean structures of the size nanometer s or smaller There are one million nanometers in a millimeter Nanotechnology tries to make materials or machines of that size People are doing many different types of work in the field of nanotechnology Most current work looks at making nanoparticles that have special properties such as the way they scatter light absorb X rays transport electrical currents or heat etc At the more science fiction end of the field are attempts to make small copies of bigger machines or really new ideas for structures that make themselves New material s are possible with nano size structures It is even possible to work with single atoms There has been a lot of discussion about the future of nanotechnology and its wikt danger danger s Nanotechnology may be able to invent new materials and instrument s which would be very useful such as in medicine computer s and making clean electricity On the other hand nanotechnology is new and there could be unknown problems For example if the materials are bad for people s health or for nature They may have a bad effect on the economy or even big natural systems like the Earth itself Some groups argue that there should be rules about the use of nanotechnology
