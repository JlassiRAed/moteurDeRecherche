 Hurricane John was the longest lived tropical cyclone ever observed tracking from the Eastern Pacific to the Western Pacific and crossing back to the Central Pacific for days total The precursor to Hurricane John was a tropical wave that moved off the coast of Africa on July th It moved across the unfavorable Atlantic and reached the Eastern Pacific on August th It slowly organized and became Tropical Depression E on August th nautical miles south southeast of Acapulco Mexico Conditions were not ideal for development but it developed banding features and well defined outflow and managed to strengthen to become Tropical Storm John later that day A strong ridge of high pressure over the Northeastern Pacific Ocean forced John westward where upper level shear kept John a tropical storm as its intensity fluctuated The shear greatly lessened greatly on the th and John became a hurricane on the th Later that day it became a major hurricane and crossed into the Central Pacific shortly thereafter Hurricane John continued to strengthen and reached a peak of knots on the rd passing nautical miles south of Hawaii John had posed a threat to the island days before but the ridge of high pressure pushed John safely south of the island The hurricane still caused heavy waves and rains though During these days John s intensity was constantly checked by Air Force Reserve aircraft reconnaissance John turned more northerly where it steadily weakened to a minimal hurricane on the th Then it crossed just north of Johnston Island where it caused moderate damage Conditions again favored strengthening and John re strengthened to a mph Category hurricane but upper level shear again weakened it John crossed the International Date Line and became Typhoon John The system continued to weaken becoming a tropical storm on the st and a tropical depression on the nd while drifting eastward John looped back to the northwest and gradually restrengthened An upper trough pulled the storm to the northeast on the th and re entered the Central Pacific on the th John became a hurricane again late on the th and retained that intensity for another day Upper level shear weakened the hurricane to a tropical storm on the th and John became extratropical in the North Central Pacific about a thousand miles south of Unalaska Island John dissipated later that day after an unprecedented days at sea
