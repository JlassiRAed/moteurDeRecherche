A period element is an Chemical element element in the first period group have similar properties The first period has less elements than any other periods in the periodic table There are only two elements in the first period hydrogen and helium We can explain why there is less elements in the first row in modern theories of atomic structure This is because in quantum physics this period fills up the s block s atomic orbital orbital Period elements follows the octet rule Exceptions duet rule they only need two electron s to complete their valence shell These elements can only hold two electrons both in the s orbital Therefore period can have only two elements
