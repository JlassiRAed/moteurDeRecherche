 Biblical inerrancy is the doctrine that the Bible in its original manuscripts is accurate and totally free from error Scripture in the original manuscripts does not affirm anything that is contrary to fact In scholars and Protestant leaders met in Chicago and produced an agreed statement It states the Bible is of infallible divine authority in all matters upon which it touches Most Evangelical Christians agree with this view but Liberal Christianity Liberal Christians do not Jesus himself quotes the Old Testament often without question but Judaism has never believed in the literal word of the Hebrew Bible There are over Greek manuscript s containing all or part of the New Testament as well as over Latin manuscripts and perhaps other manuscripts in various other languages Additionally there are the Patristic writings which contain copious quotes across the early centuries of the scriptures Inerrancy is only applied to the original autographs rather than the copies
