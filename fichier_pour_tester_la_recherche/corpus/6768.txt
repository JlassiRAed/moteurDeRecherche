 Validity is an idea that is used in everyday language and in logic In ordinary language it means correct or in the right form An argument is valid if it seems appropriate well grounded and can be defended A contract is valid if it is enforceable in law In other words it applies legally to a particular situation A bank note is valid if it can be exchanged and used for purchase and a passport is valid if it lets the holder come in and go out of a country A Will will is valid if correctly made and certified by an appropriate court In all these cases valid refers to the soundness in some situation Logical uses of this idea are similar but phrased much more exactly
